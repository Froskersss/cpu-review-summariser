Hello,
This is my project submission for Summer Internship Evaluation for the university of Amity University Haryana for the academic year 2025/26.
This is a cpu review summariser project.
Idea:
As an avid fan of technology launchings one of the industries i follow very closely is the personal computer industry.
And often times when reading reviews. It becomes a tedious task to read all the reviews.
So this project was created to get review articles from more than 1 site summarise them and then present it as a review that contains parts of reviews of all the websites.
Websites selected: Techpowerup.com and Techspot.com
These 2 websites are very reliable websites so these were chosen.
CPUs chosen:
ryzen 9 9950x3d
intel 9 285k
intel i7 14700k
ryzen 7 7700x
intel i5 13600k
ryzen 5 5600x
Why this lineup?
This lineup was chosen because it presented all the different tiers of cpus of both competitors.
The review articles were scraped from the websites using ethical web scraping practices. 
These articles were then summarised using the Google T5-base LLM model. 
This model was choosen because of its high performance in text to text scenarios.
After the summarization a basic front end was created to show the summarization to the end user.
This front end was implemented using flask.
