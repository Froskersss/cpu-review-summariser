ryzen 9 9950x3d,"Four months have passed since the release of AMD's impressive Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU, and it seems the market still can't get enough of it. Supply has been reasonable, but demand has been overwhelming. And because this is yet another in-demand product built using TSMC's N4 process, the 9800X3D is fighting for supply with countless other sought-after chips. As a result, even today, the 9800X3D is often out of stock and difficult to purchase at MSRP. We should mention that when we were writing this Newegg had it in stock for $480 and it was their number one best-selling CPU. The reason for its extreme popularity is simple – the 9800X3D is the world's fastest gaming processor, without exception, and at $480, it is affordable compared to even a basic graphics card. The only downside is that it isn't particularly strong in productivity workloads. For those who need both work and gaming performance, alternatives like the 7950X3D or Core Ultra 9 285K have been better choices. That changes today with the release of the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, along with its sidekick, the 9900X3D. The 9950X3D is a 16-core/32-thread Zen 4-based processor featuring two 8-core CCDs, one of which is equipped with AMD's 3D V-Cache technology. It is priced at $700 – the same MSRP as the previous generation 7950X3D. Meanwhile, the 12-core/24-thread 9900X3D is set to launch at $600, again matching the MSRP of its predecessor. Ryzen 9 9950X3D Ryzen 9 9950X Ryzen 9 9900X3D Ryzen 9 9900X Price (MSRP) $700 $650 $600 $500 Release Date March 12, 2025 Aug 15, 2024 March 12, 2025 Aug 15, 2024 Cores / Threads 16 / 32 12 / 24 Base Clock 4.3 GHz 4.4 GHz Boost Clock 5.7 GHz 5.5 GHz 5.6 GHz L3 Cache (Total) 128 MB 64 MB 128 MB 64 MB Box Cooler N/A Chiplets 2 x CCD, 1 x I/O Core Config 2 x 8 TDP 170 W 120 W We have heard that initial supply for these new CPUs is quite good, particularly for high-end models. However, as was the case with the 9800X3D , it's unlikely there will be enough supply to meet demand, so getting one will likely be a challenge, at least for the next month or so. AMD has only sent out the 9950X3D for review, and frankly, it's the only part that truly makes sense. The 9900X3D is just 16% cheaper than the 9950X3D yet has 25% fewer cores, making it a poor value proposition. Worse still, only six cores have direct access to the larger 3D V-Cache, making it less effective for gaming. In a way, it's essentially an overpriced 6-core processor. Unless the 9900X3D is offered at a 30% discount relative to the 9950X3D, it isn't worth considering. This is likely why AMD has opted not to send it out for review. It may seem odd that these Zen 4, dual-CCD 3D V-Cache processors are only being released now – four months after the 9800X3D. Supply constraints could be a factor, but another possibility is that AMD has been refining scheduling optimizations to prevent the 9950X3D from falling behind the 9800X3D in certain games due to improper CCD usage or excessive cross-CCD communication. To improve performance and ensure better scheduling, AMD has updated its Provisioning Packages Service and 3D V-Cache Performance Optimizer. Additionally, AMD is introducing a new Application Compatibility Database. The Provisioning Packages Service is a significant update, as it eliminates the need to reinstall Windows for a new Ryzen processor to function correctly. However, AMD still recommends a fresh install. The service monitors the system, and if it detects a change in CPU name, core count, logical processor count, or L3 cache size, it will automatically uninstall and reinstall the necessary drivers. This service is designed to optimize CPU power and performance for dual-CCD processors when gaming. It achieves this through a combination of power and frequency adjustments, along with core parking while using the Windows Game Mode power profile. These optimizations may be dynamically applied to specific power profiles, typically when launching an application. When the operating system detects that a game is running, it ""parks"" the cores on the non-3D V-Cache-enabled CCD, making those cores temporarily unavailable to the OS. Then there's the AMD 3D V-Cache Performance Optimizer, which enhances the performance of Ryzen 9 3D V-Cache processors for both gaming and non-gaming tasks by dynamically adjusting the favored processor cores based on the active application. When gaming, the operating system prioritizes cores connected to the larger L3 cache. Conversely, for non-gaming tasks, it prioritizes the highest-frequency cores. Unlike the Provisioning Packages Service, this software does not park cores. Finally, there's the AMD Application Compatibility Database, which requires both a new BIOS and chipset driver. This database is designed to address problematic games that cannot be fully optimized through the Provisioning Packages and supports all dual-CCD models. Currently, it includes optimizations for Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, Dying Light 2, Far Cry 6 , Metro Exodus , Total War: Three Kingdoms, Total War: Warhammer III, and Wolfenstein: Youngblood. So a lot of effort has gone into ensuring that, when it comes to gaming, the 9950X3D performs just as well as the 9800X3D. We look forward to testing this claim with the 12 games in our day-one reviews and later exploring it further with a 40 – 50-game benchmark. For now though let's go over the data we have… Test System Specs CPU Motherboard Memory AMD Ryzen 9000 Series AMD Ryzen 7000 Series Gigabyte X670E Aorus Master [BIOS F34b] G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 32GB DDR5-6000 CL30-38-38-96 Windows 11 24H2 AMD Ryzen 5000 Series MSI MPG X570S Carbon MAX WiFi [BIOS 7D52v1B1] G.Skill Ripjaws V Series 32GB DDR4-3600 CL14-15-15-35 Windows 11 24H2 Intel Core Ultra 200S Asus ROG Maximus Z890 Hero [BIOS 1501] G.Skill Trident Z5 CK 32GB DDR5-8200 CL40-52-52-131 Windows 11 23H2 [24H2 = Slower] Intel 12th, 13th & 14th MSI MPG Z790 Carbon WiFi [BIOS 7D89v1E] G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 32GB DDR5-7200 CL34-45-45-115 Windows 11 23H2 [24H2 = Slower] Graphics Card Power Supply Storage Asus ROG Strix RTX 4090 OC Edition Kolink Regulator Gold ATX 3.0 1200W TeamGroup T-Force Cardea A440 M.2 PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD 4TB GeForce Game Ready Driver 572.70 WHQL CPU Clock Behavior (Stock, PBO, Eco Mode) First, let's take a look at how the 9950X3D behaves out of the box with nothing more than EXPO settings applied. After half an hour of looping Cinebench's multi-core test, we recorded an average core clock frequency of 5,085 MHz and a peak CPU temperature of 84°C. These results were recorded in an ATX case using a 360mm AIO. To enable PBO, we did this manually in the BIOS and benchmarked this configuration, which you will see in the following graphs. Using the advanced PBO options, the PPT, TDC, and EDC were all manually maxed out, the PBO scalar was set to 10X, the boost clock override was set to +200 MHz, and the curve optimizer was set to -20. Under these conditions, we saw an average clock frequency of 5,227 MHz, a mere 3% frequency increase over stock. However, because we used a negative curve optimizer, the peak CPU temperature dropped from 84°C to just 78°C, as the average package power dropped from 193W down to 186W. Finally, we also benchmarked the 9950X3D using Eco mode, which reduced the all-core frequency by almost 30% to 3,633 MHz. As a result, we saw a peak CPU temperature of just 61°C with a package power of only 88W. Productivity Benchmarks Cinebench 2024, Multi Core Now, let's look at Cinebench multi-core performance. Out of the box, the 9950X3D scored 2,448 points, making it 4% faster than the standard 9950X in our testing. However, to be fully transparent, we have not had a chance to update our 9950X data with the latest chipset drivers. When compared to the 285K , the 9950X3D was just 3% slower, and our 285K data is up to date. It's also worth noting that when compared to the 9800X3D, we observed a 77% performance boost. Manually enabling max PBO resulted in only a small 3% increase, while the power-efficient Eco mode reduced performance by 25%. We will examine power consumption shortly. Cinebench 2024, Single Core As for single-core performance, it remains the same as what we previously observed from the 9950X, scoring 141 points. The same performance was achieved using PBO, while the Eco mode resulted in just a one-point drop. When compared to the 285K, the 9950X3D was 6% slower. Cinebench 2024, Power Consumption When it comes to power consumption, we measured 229W across the EPS12V rails, the same power draw as the 9950X and 7950X. Thanks to a negative offset, PBO slightly reduced power consumption. The Eco mode, which also led to a 25% performance reduction, managed to cut power consumption by almost 60%, making it significantly more power-efficient. It's impressive that, for the same power draw as the 9600X, the 9950X3D delivers 87% more performance in this test. 7-Zip File Manager Compression Next, we have the 7-Zip File Manager Compression test, where the 9950X3D leads, outperforming the 7950X3D by 7% and the 9950X by 15%. This performance margin is similar to what we saw between the 9700X and 9800X3D. Even when using Eco mode, the 9950X3D still matched the 9950X, making it just 4% slower than the 285K while sipping power. 7-Zip File Manager Decompression For decompression performance, the 9950X3D is comparable to the 9950X and 7950X, making it 31% faster than the 285K. Even in Eco mode, the 9950X3D was just 2% slower than the 285K, so AMD is crushing Intel in this workload. Blender Open Data Moving on to the Blender results, the 9950X3D once again tops the charts, coming in just 4% faster than both the 285K and 9950X. Enabling Eco mode kills performance, dropping the samples per minute to 202 – an almost 30% reduction from stock. However, this is still roughly twice the performance of the 9600X for a similar power draw. Corona 10 Benchmark The 9950X3D also tops the charts in Corona , beating Intel's 285K by a 13% margin and the previous generation 7950X by 20%. Enabling max PBO only provided an additional 4% boost, but it still resulted in the best performance we have seen from a mainstream platform to date. Adobe Photoshop 2025 Photoshop does not take full advantage of high-core-count CPUs, so the 9950X3D does not offer much improvement over the 9800X3D. In fact, out of the box, it was slightly slower. However, compared to the 285K, the 9950X3D was nearly 20% faster, making for a significant performance advantage. Adobe Premiere Pro 2024 Premiere Pro benefits more from higher core counts but not to the same extent as 3D rendering tests. The 9950X3D was 5% slower than the 285K but matched the 14900K when running in low-power Eco mode. Gaming Benchmarks Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Time for the gaming benchmarks, and we'll start with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Here, the 9950X3D was able to match the 9800X3D, which is a great result, though really to be expected given the 7950X3D matched the 7800X3D. This points to the 9950X3D being a significantly better all-rounder, especially for those who also want high-end gaming performance from a workstation, as the 9950X3D is 52% faster than the 285K here. The 7950X3D and 7800X3D were also comparable in The Last of Us Part 1, and the same is true of the 9950X3D and 9800X3D, with the dual-CCD Zen 4 part allowing for 210 fps, making it just 7% faster than the 285K in this example. Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Now, the Cyberpunk 2077 results are interesting. Here, the 9950X3D allowed for 216 fps, making it just 1% slower than the 9800X3D, so in other words, performance was much the same. That's a great result because the 7950X3D is 8% slower than the 7800X3D here, and we've seen a bit of this in the past, where the dual-CCD model can be anywhere from a bit slower to a lot slower for gaming, and AMD has been working to solve this. Assetto Corsa Competizione Scheduling issues weren't a problem for the 7950X3D in Assetto Corsa Competizione, as we can see it matched the 7800X3D. The same is true of the 9950X3D, which was able to match – or even slightly nudge ahead of – the 9800X3D, delivering chart-topping results. This also meant that the 9950X3D was an insane 77% faster than the 285K in this game. Remnant II Remnant II is another game where we previously didn't see any scheduling issues, so the 9950X3D performed as expected, delivering a few more frames than the 9800X3D, making it 33% faster than the 285K. Homeworld 3 The 9950X3D was a beast in Homeworld 3, despite slipping behind the 9800X3D by a small 4% margin. That's an excellent result given the 7950X3D was a massive 25% slower than the 7800X3D. This also meant that the 9950X3D was 52% faster than Intel's 285K. A Plague Tale: Requiem The 7950X3D had some frame pacing issues in A Plague Tale: Requiem, and as a result, it ended up trailing the 7800X3D by a 6% margin when comparing the average frame rate and 20% slower for the 1% lows. The 9950X3D, on the other hand, behaves like the 9800X3D, delivering the same excellent performance, making it 58% faster than the 285K. By the way, we went back and re-tested the 285K, and sadly, in cases like this where performance is horrible, Intel has been unable to improve the situation. Counter-Strike 2 The 7950X3D was only slightly slower than the 7800X3D in Counter-Strike 2, but whatever the issue was, it has been cleared up with the 9950X3D, which matched the 9800X3D almost exactly. This also made it 29% faster than the 285K. Starfield The previous-generation CPUs didn't suffer any major scheduling issues in Starfield , so unsurprisingly, the 9950X3D performs like a 9800X3D here, making it 11% faster than the 285K. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Next up, we have Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 , and here, the 9950X3D is delivering 9800X3D-like performance, which is great news as the 7950X3D was 10% slower than the 7800X3D in this title. This also means that, compared to the 285K, the 9950X3D is 25% faster. Hitman 3 The Hitman 3 results are really surprising because here, the 9950X3D is actually 6% faster than the 9800X3D, allowing for 306 fps – a 14% boost over the 285K. That's also a great result, as the 7950X3D was 4% slower than the 7800X3D. Watch Dogs: Legion Finally, we have Watch Dogs: Legion, and here, the 9950X3D was 3% faster than the 9800X3D, making it a massive 39% faster than the 285K. Overall, excellent gaming performance from the 9950X3D. Power Consumption When Gaming Cyberpunk 2077 Now, when it comes to power consumption, the 9950X3D consumed 44% more power than the 9800X3D in Cyberpunk 2077 , matching the 12900K and consuming just 8% less power than the 285K. But let's look at power efficiency when factoring in the resulting fps performance. Cyberpunk 2077 - Watt per Frame Here, we can see that in terms of power efficiency, the 9950X3D is comparable to the 9600X and 7600X, making it 35% more power-efficient than the 285K in this example. Still, it was 48% less efficient than the 9800X3D, though that gap was reduced to 17% when using Eco mode. The Last of Us Part 1 Measuring power usage in The Last of Us Part 1 saw the 9950X3D consume 32% more power than the 9800X3D but 14% less than the 285K. So, let's see how that works out when calculating efficiency. The Last of Us Part 1 - Watt per Frame The 9950X3D is comparable to the 5800X3D or 7600X when it comes to power efficiency, making it around 30% less efficient than the 9800X3D and 37% less efficient than the 7950X3D. Still, when compared to the 285K, we're looking at an almost 20% improvement in efficiency. Performance Summary Here's the 12-game average data, and no surprises – the 9950X3D is a beast, taking the top spot and delivering essentially the same performance as the class-leading 9800X3D. Even in Eco mode, it was on average 8% faster than the 7800X3D and 31% faster than the 285K. Overall, we're only looking at a 1.4% performance boost from PBO, at least across the games we tested, but this did improve power efficiency, so it might be worth considering. That said, the overall performance is outstanding and remarkably consistent for a dual-CCD processor – AMD has finally nailed it. X3D Turbo Mode: Enabled vs Disabled Gigabyte made a big deal out of X3D Turbo Mode when they first introduced it in their BIOS, making bold claims about performance gains. At the time, no one really knew what it did. Since then, we've learned that it's a mostly useless feature that few would actually use. In short, this mode disables the second CCD entirely, along with SMT support, reducing a processor like the 9950X3D from a 16-core/32-thread CPU down to an 8-core/8-thread one. Gigabyte also tweaks some memory timings for better gaming performance. The idea is to ensure that games run on the CCD with the 3D V-Cache while disabling SMT, which can sometimes negatively impact gaming performance. However, our testing indicates that leaving SMT enabled is generally beneficial for gaming. The biggest issue with this feature is that it can only be enabled at the BIOS level, meaning the system must be completely reset every time you want to toggle it on or off. It's not something you can quickly and easily switch within Windows before launching a game. If a toggle option were available, this would be an incredibly useful and practical feature. With X3D Turbo Mode enabled, we saw a 3% improvement on average across the dozen games tested, with notable gains in titles like Homeworld 3 and Space Marine 2. However, there were also significant performance drops in other games, such as Starfield and The Last of Us Part I. Cost per Frame For those solely interested in gaming, the 9950X3D doesn't make sense from a cost perspective, given that it costs $700 and delivers similar gaming performance to the much cheaper 9800X3D. Of course, if cost isn't a concern, there's no reason not to choose the 9950X3D over the 9800X3D, as both should provide essentially the same gaming performance. However, for those who prioritize value while still seeking high-end performance, the 9800X3D or even the 7800X3D is a much smarter choice. For a higher-core-count CPU, though, the 9950X3D is the best all-around solution, generally matching or beating the productivity performance of the Core Ultra 9 285K, while smashing it for gaming and offering better overall value. Bonus DDR Results A quick additional data point before our conclusion. G.Skill recently sent over their new Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5-6000 CL28-36-36-96 memory kit, so we decided to test how it performs with the 9950X3D. One of the known benefits of 3D V-Cache processors is that they aren't particularly sensitive to memory performance, so unsurprisingly, we saw minimal improvement with the lower-latency memory kit. This is good news, as 32GB CL30 kits can be found for under $100, making memory an affordable component. What We Learned The Ryzen 9 9950X3D is an easy recommendation with very few caveats. It's fair to say this new Ryzen chip has cemented itself as the best all-around processor for those seeking ultimate performance for both work and play. If productivity is your primary focus, the 9950X3D is likely the best option outside of a super expensive Threadripper processor. In workloads like Cinebench , the 9950X3D and Intel's 285K were neck and neck, with the Ryzen processor consuming just over 10% less power. In general, they should be highly competitive for productivity tasks, but as always, it's best to research specific application performance based on your workflow. Where Intel falls behind significantly is in gaming. Here, the 9950X3D delivered, on average, 35% more performance – a mind-blowing margin unlike anything seen before in AMD vs. Intel comparisons, certainly prior to the release of the 9800X3D . It appears that AMD has effectively addressed the scheduling issues that previously affected 3D V-Cache-enabled dual-CCD processors, at least based on the games we tested. Of course, we will need to analyze this further in future content, but for now, we recommend checking out multiple reviews to get a broader perspective, as different sources will cover a wide range of games. The key takeaway here is that buying a dual-CCD processor with 3D V-Cache is now a far more reliable choice for gamers. There's significantly less need to rely on third-party applications to manually fix scheduling issues, making the overall experience much smoother. The 9950X3D is by far the best dual-CCD processor AMD has released – it just works, and it works exceptionally well.

core ultra 9 285k,"Today, we can finally take the covers off Intel's latest CPU generation, the ""Core Ultra"" series, codenamed Arrow Lake. The Arrow Lake architecture is new for desktop systems, using a tile-based processor design, with the goal of moving away from a large monolithic chip based on the latest node and instead splitting the CPU into blocks, or ""tiles,"" as they're commonly referred to. This approach allows Intel to develop the CPU cores and iGPU using cutting-edge nodes, while other aspects of the processor, such as I/O interfaces, can be built using an older, more cost-effective node. This approach is similar to what AMD has been doing with Ryzen . Since Arrow Lake represents such a radical change from the previous Raptor Lake generation, we could spend a lot of time discussing the architectural and platform changes, some of which we've been covering over time in anticipation for this release. However, since most of you are here for the benchmarks and actual performance results, we'll quickly go over the flagship CPU we're testing today, touch on the new platform, and then dive into the graphs. Meet the new Core Ultra 9 285K The new flagship is the Core Ultra 9 285K. Yes, it's not the best name, and yes, the 'Ultra' is unnecessary, but Intel is just following the trend – modern product names tend to be unnecessarily long and somewhat uninspired, so that box is checked. The 285K features 8 P-Cores with 8 threads, as Hyper-Threading is no longer used. These P-Cores have a base frequency of 3.7 GHz, boosting up to 5.6 GHz, with a thermal velocity boost of 5.7 GHz – resulting in a 5% frequency reduction compared to the 14900K . There are also 16 E-Cores, each with 1 thread, as there is no SMT support here. These E-Cores operate at a base frequency of 3.2 GHz, with a boost up to 4.6 GHz, which is a 5% increase over the E-Cores in the 14900K. Processor Release price P-core (performance) E-core (efficiency) L3 cache Cores (threads) Freq. Turbo L2 cache Cores (threads) Freq. Turbo L2 cache Core Ultra 9 285K $600 8 (8) 3.7 GHz 5.6 GHz 24 MB 16 (16) 3.2 GHz 4.6 GHz 16 MB 36 MB Core Ultra 7 265K $395 8 (8) 3.9 GHz 5.5 GHz 12 (12) 3.3 GHz 12 MB 30 MB Core Ultra 5 245K $310 6 (6) 4.2 GHz 5.2 GHz 18 MB 8 (8) 3.6 GHz 8 MB 24 MB Core i9-14900K $600 8 (16) 3.2 GHz 6.0 GHz 16 MB 16 (16) 2.4 GHz 4.4 GHz 16 MB 36 MB Core i7-14700K $420 8 (16) 3.4 GHz 5.6 GHz 12 (12) 2.5 GHz 4.3 GHz 12 MB 33 MB Core i5-14600K $330 6 (12) 3.5 GHz 5.3 GHz 12 MB 8 (8) 2.6 GHz 4.0 GHz 8 MB 24 MB In total, there are 36 MB of L3 cache and 40 MB of L2 cache. Each P-Core gets 3 MB of L2 cache, while the E-Cores are grouped into clusters of four, with each cluster sharing 4 MB of L2 cache. Finally, the base TDP is 125W, with a max turbo TDP of 250W. Intel is pricing this at $590 per 1,000 units, so we expect an initial retail price of at least $600. It's also worth noting that all K-SKU models, which are the only ones announced so far, support dual-channel DDR5-5600 UDIMM memory or DDR5-6400 CUDIMM memory. CUDIMM memory includes a small clock driver circuit directly on the module, enabling more precise timings required at higher memory speeds. All CPUs provide 20 PCIe 5.0 lanes and 4 PCIe 4.0 lanes, along with an 8-lane Direct Media Interface 4.0 bus to the chipset. As usual, the K-suffix processors have an unlocked multiplier, making them ideal for overclocking. A New Socket With Arrow Lake, Intel has moved away from the LGA1700 socket, switching to LGA1851. Despite the increased pin count, the new socket maintains the same dimensions and cooler mounting hole spacing as LGA1700, ensuring continued compatibility with existing CPU coolers. For testing, we used a number of new motherboards, primarily the Asus ROG Maximus Z890 Hero and MSI MEG Z890 Unify-X. A substantial number of BIOS updates were needed to achieve the performance figures we're about to present, so it's fair to say the Arrow Lake review process has been far from smooth. Testing Notes First, to be transparent, we had very limited time to prepare this review, as Intel only sent us the review kit three days before the embargo lifted. Three days is not enough time to run all the tests we'd like to, so some tests will be covered in follow-up content. Since these CPUs will be available for purchase on October 24th, we wanted to have a review ready to help guide your buying decisions. However, delays in receiving review samples turned out to be the least of our concerns, as Arrow Lake is currently a bit of a hot mess, so much so that we're not sure where to start. Let's start with Windows 11. Many of you know that Windows 11 24H2 was released a few weeks ago, significantly improving gaming performance for modern Ryzen processors in some cases. It even benefits 13th and 14th-gen Intel models. However, when updating our data, we noticed that 12th-gen Intel CPUs performed noticeably worse on 24H2 compared to 23H2. This issue wasn't limited to 12th-gen processors. We encountered serious performance and stability problems with Arrow Lake on 24H2. After multiple fresh installs failed to resolve the issue, we had to revert to testing on 23H2. This is less than ideal, as we know some games perform worse on the older version of Windows 11. Even with a fresh 23H2 install, we still experienced stability issues with the 285K. Games would occasionally crash, as would certain applications. The problem was worse when using the DDR5-8200 memory provided for testing. This persisted even after numerous BIOS revisions for two different motherboards. We expect these teething issues will be addressed quickly, though we are unsure why 24H2 caused so many problems. It's particularly odd because Intel reportedly did all their benchmarking on 24H2 using the Insider Preview build from August and did not report any issues. Nevertheless, we've spoken with multiple reviewers who also encountered problems, even with 23H2, and board manufacturers confirmed there are issues with 24H2. Test System Specs Before we get into the benchmark data, here are the test specs and systems used. One thing to note is that we benchmarked the 285K with both DDR5-7200 and DDR5-8200 memory. CPU Motherboard Memory AMD Ryzen 7000 Series Gigabyte X670E Aorus Master [BIOS F33d] G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 32GB DDR5-6000 CL30-38-38-96 Windows 11 24H2 AMD Ryzen 5000 Series MSI MPG X570S Carbon MAX WiFi [BIOS 7D52v19] G.Skill Ripjaws V Series 32GB DDR4-3600 CL14-15-15-35 Windows 11 24H2 Intel Core Ultra 200S Asus ROG Maximus Z890 Hero [BIOS 0805] G.Skill Trident Z5 CK 32GB DDR5-8200 CL40-52-52-131 G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 32GB DDR5-7200 CL34-45-45-115 Windows 11 23H2 [24H2 = Slower] Intel 12th, 13th & 14th MSI MPG Z790 Carbon WiFi [BIOS 7D89v1E] G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 32GB DDR5-7200 CL34-45-45-115 Windows 11 23H2 [24H2 = Slower] Graphics Card Power Supply Storage Asus ROG Strix RTX 4090 OC Edition Kolink Regulator Gold ATX 3.0 1200W TeamGroup T-Force Cardea A440 M.2 PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD 4TB GeForce Game Ready Driver 565.90 WHQL The 7200 CL34 memory runs with much tighter timings compared to the DDR5-8200 CL40 memory. If an application or game is more latency-sensitive, the 7200 memory may perform better. However, if bandwidth is the limiting factor, the 8200 kit might have the advantage. Now, let's see how the numbers shake out... Productivity Benchmarks Cinebench Clock Behavior First, let's take a look at how the 285K behaves under load. For cooling, we are using the new MSI MAG Coreliquid I360, which was provided in our review kit and is specifically designed and optimized for the new Arrow Lake CPUs. MSI has developed a unique bracket that shifts the cold plate north, resulting in a 3-degree reduction in temperature as it better targets the hotspot on these new CPUs. A nice feature of this design is that the unique mounting bracket also provides optimal coverage for LGA1700, AM4, and even AM5 processors, making it a versatile, one-size-fits-all solution. With the Coreliquid I360 installed, we loaded up the 285K with Cinebench and observed an average clock frequency of 4.6 GHz on the E-Cores and 5.3 GHz on the P-Cores, all while staying within the stock 250W power limit. The CPU reached a peak core temperature of 84°C, which is well below the 105°C TjMAX. Cinebench 2024, Multi Core Now for the benchmark graphs: the Cinebench multi-core performance looks very strong. We already know that E-Cores work well in this type of workload, based on previous models. The E-Cores in the 285K are based on an updated architecture and run at slightly higher clock speeds. Using either DDR5-7200 or 8200 memory, we saw a score of just over 2,500 points, making the 285K 14% faster than the 14900K and 7% faster than the 9950X. Cinebench 2024, Single Core When we look at single-core performance, the Arrow Lake P-Cores continue to impress, with the 285K being 13% faster than the 14900K and 6% faster than the 9950X – another great result. Cinebench 2024 Power Consumption Next, let's discuss power consumption. This part of the review gave us some trouble, but thanks to Steve from Gamers Nexus , we were able to catch an issue with the testing. The Asus ROG Maximus Z890 Hero has a unique design: instead of delivering all the CPU power through the dual EPS12V rails, four of the vCore power stages are connected to the 24-pin ATX power cable. Initially, we were puzzled as to why the 285K, with a 250W limit, was drawing only 196W. After Gamers Nexus alerted us to this, we confirmed that about 50-60W of power was being supplied via the 24-pin ATX cable. This was later confirmed by Asus engineers. After retesting with the MSI MEG Z890 Unify-X, we confirmed the correct EPS12V data, showing the 285K drawing 258W during this test. While this is an improvement over the 14900K, it's not particularly impressive, considering the 9950X was only 7% slower but consumed 11% less power. Even more concerning is that the 7950X3D was just 13% slower than the 285K but used a massive 43% less power. However, compared to the highly inefficient 14900K, the 285K represents a step in the right direction, consuming 17% less power while delivering 14% more performance. 7-Zip File Manager Compression When it comes to compression performance, the 285K is solid, but not groundbreaking. It performs similarly to the 14900K, 9950X, and 7950X. While it's not a huge leap forward for a new generation, it's certainly not a bad result. 7-Zip File Manager Decompression However, decompression performance is quite weak, largely due to the removal of SMT. As a result, when using the same frequency memory, the 285K is 9% slower than the 14900K and a significant 25% slower than the 9950X. Blender Open Data The Blender Open Data results are good, though not exceptional, as the 285K matches the 9950X. However, given the improved power efficiency, this is still a positive outcome overall. Corona 10 Benchmark In the Corona 10 Benchmark, the 285K performs well, though it's 9% slower than the 9950X, despite showing a 17% performance increase over the 14900K. Adobe Photoshop 2025 Despite the impressive single-core scores seen in Cinebench, the 285K's performance in the lightly threaded Photoshop benchmark is disappointing. It's slightly slower than the Core i5-12600K, making it one of the slowest CPUs we've tested in this benchmark, which is both puzzling and disappointing. Adobe Premiere Pro 2024 Fortunately, performance in Adobe Premiere Pro is much better, though still slightly behind the 14900K. This result, while better, is still underwhelming for a next-generation product. Gaming Benchmarks Let's dive into the gaming benchmarks, starting with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Ryzen processors received a notable performance boost in this title with Windows 11 24H2. While the gains for 14th-gen Intel processors were smaller, they were still present. Unfortunately, parts like the 285K are currently around 5-10% slower on 24H2, so the 285K data presented here was gathered using 23H2. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Ignoring the X3D CPUs, which are blazing fast in this test, the Intel 285K delivered fairly mid-range performance, coming in 4% slower than the 14900K. Additionally, the lower-latency DDR5-7200 memory was slightly faster than the 8200 memory in this case. The Last of Us Part 1 The 285K performed impressively in The Last of Us Part 1 , delivering performance comparable to the 7800X3D and slightly faster than the 14900K. However, with the same 7200 memory, we only observed a 2% improvement, which is underwhelming for a next-gen product. Some might even call it a disappointment. Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty This is where things really go off the rails. You might see reviews where the 285K performs similarly to the 14900K in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty , but those reviews likely used the built-in benchmark or tested sections of the game that aren't very CPU-intensive. We have evidence for this, which we will explain later. In more CPU-demanding sections of the game, the 285K struggles significantly. We've spent considerable time attempting to extract more performance in this test, with the best results coming from lower-latency memory, where tightening timings helped the most. However, despite testing motherboards from MSI, Gigabyte, Asrock, and Asus, and even performing multiple fresh Windows installs, the 285K remained at least 20% slower than the 14900K, making it the slowest CPU in this test. Hogwarts Legacy Performance in Hogwarts Legacy is better, but still poor overall. The 285K lagged behind the 14900K, making it slower than even the Ryzen 7 7700X . It's surprising to see how much Windows 11 23H2 was holding back Zen 4 and Zen 5 processors, as we now regularly find the 7700X matching the 14900K's performance. Additionally, the Intel CPU is no longer running without power limits. Assetto Corsa Competizione In ACC, the 285K fell behind the 14900K by 5%, making it 14% slower than the 9700X and 32% slower than the 7950X3D, meaning Arrow Lake is not an ideal choice for this driving simulator. Remnant II Remnant II produced data closer to what Intel had promised, with the 1% lows being significantly better on the 285K compared to the 14900K. However, despite matching Intel's previous flagship, the 285K still trailed behind the Zen 4 X3D parts. Homeworld 3 Another game where the 285K's performance falls to the bottom of the chart is Homeworld 3. In this test, the 285K delivered Core i5-12600K -like performance, making it almost 20% slower than the 14900K and 7950X3D, and at least 23% slower than the 9700X . A Plague Tale: Requiem Performance in A Plague Tale: Requiem is also shocking. If you've seen other reviews showing much better results in this title, we'll explain the discrepancy later. For now, the 285K is underwhelming, allowing for just over 120 fps on average, with 1% lows in the mid-70s. It's at least 17% slower than the 14900K and 27% slower than the 7950X3D, again delivering Core i5-12600K-like performance, making it even slower than the Ryzen 5 7600X . Counter-Strike 2 In Counter-Strike 2, the results align more closely with Intel's promises, with the 285K roughly matching the 14900K. While it's good to see this kind of parity, it's far from the norm based on our other tests, and still an underwhelming result overall. Starfield Interestingly, the 285K delivered its best performance in Starfield , narrowly beating the 14900K and even surpassing the 7950X3D . However, using the same memory, it was only 2% faster than the 14900K, which, while one of the better results we've seen, is still disappointing for a new generation. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Space Marine 2 ran fine on the 285K, though this new flagship only offered mid-tier performance, coming in slower than the 14700K and roughly matching the Ryzen 7 7700X. It's not a disaster, but far from impressive. Hitman 3 The 285K performed decently in Hitman 3, being one of the fastest CPUs in this title. However, it was still slightly slower than the 14900K – by just 2% – so it's hard to get too excited about this result, as we're looking at 14700K-like performance. Watch Dogs: Legion For testing Watch Dogs: Legion, we used the built-in benchmark, but averaged the data from six runs, as the initial results are often inflated. To accurately compare with this data, you'll need to take an average of six back-to-back runs. Doing so reveals extremely disappointing results for the 285K, which only matched the 14600K and 9600X with 162 fps on average. This made it 11% slower than the 14900K and 20% slower than the 7950X3D. Star Wars Outlaws Finally, in Star Wars Outlaws , the lower-latency DDR5-7200 memory provided the best results, with 134 fps – the same performance level as the 12900K. And with that, we conclude our highly disappointing gaming benchmarks. Side-by-Side Data To recap, here's how the 14900K and 285K compared, both using DDR5-7200 memory. On average, the 285K was 6% slower across the 14 games we tested, with significant losses in Watch Dogs: Legion, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Homeworld 3, and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty . Gaming Power Consumption Arrow Lake makes significant strides in power efficiency, and while it's much improved over the 14900K, the results still fall short when compared to Ryzen processors. In our Cyberpunk testing, we observed a substantial 32% reduction in power usage for the 285K compared to the 14900K. However, it still consumed 28% more power than the 9950X, and performance for the 285K was poor in this title. Let's now look at a game where the 285K performed better. In The Last of Us Part 1, the 285K consumed 32% less power than the 14900K, which is impressive given it was a few percent faster. Unfortunately, when compared to the 7950X3D, the 285K used 71% more power for the same level of performance, which is disappointing. While Intel has made improvements in power efficiency, reducing power consumption by almost 70W from the 14900K, it still lags behind AMD, especially at the current performance levels. 14 Game Average Looking at the 14-game average, we see that the 285K is 5% slower than the 14900K, when calculating using the geometric mean. This means that, on average, it's slightly slower than the 7700X and about on par with the 9600X, which is quite surprising. It's also 14% slower than the 7950X3D. Here, we see just how much Ryzen processors have benefited from the 24H2 update, with the 7800X3D being 14% faster than the 14900K, which is remarkable. Of course, we are now power-limiting the Core i9, but even so, that margin is impressive. Cost Per Frame Typically, our cost-per-frame analysis for CPUs includes the cost of the motherboard and memory, but in this case, the prices for those components are quite similar. While this may reduce the overall margins slightly, the picture is clear: the 285K offers poor value for gamers. It provides similar value to the 9950X, making it much worse than the 7950X3D, which is probably the best all-rounder at the moment. It also performs worse than the outgoing 14900K, which we have never recommended. Interestingly, the 7800X3D, which has sold for as little as $340 this year, still offers far better value at $480. Even with recent price increases, the 7800X3D remains a strong contender in terms of value. Windows 24H2 Gaming Performance As mentioned earlier, Arrow Lake's gaming performance was even worse on Windows 11 24H2. Intel is aware of this issue and has suggested enabling the 'high performance' or 'high power' profile in Windows for optimal performance on 24H2. They also speculated that there might be an issue with the ring bus clock on 24H2, suggesting a BIOS change by disabling the 'CCF Auto GV' setting. We explored these suggestions using a limited set of gaming benchmarks to see the impact. Additionally, we included a fresh install of Windows 10, as many users still rely on this OS and may be curious about the 285K's performance on it. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Looking at the 23H2 data, the 285K's performance improved by 3% when using Windows 10, which is a good sign. However, it's likely that parts like the 14900K would see a similar or possibly greater performance uplift. Using the default 24H2 configuration with the balanced power profile severely hindered the 285K, reducing the average frame rate by 8% compared to 23H2, with the 1% lows dropping by 36%. Clearly, something is wrong here. Switching to the 'high performance' power plan improved the frame rate to 150 fps on average, though still below what we saw with 23H2, but a notable improvement nonetheless. Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty In Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty , the 285K performed best using 23H2, with a slight frame drop when using Windows 10, though the difference was within the margin of error. Interestingly, the 24H2 balanced power plan performed better here, as the frame rate regressed by 3% when switching to the high performance profile. Adjusting the 'CCF Auto GV' setting had no impact, similar to what we saw in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Homeworld 3 The Homeworld 3 data underscores just how erratic the Arrow Lake testing has been, though the results align with expectations. We know Homeworld 3 performs poorly on 23H2, while 24H2 significantly boosts performance for Intel's 13th and 14th-gen and AMD Ryzen processors. The fact that Windows 10 performed 20% better than 23H2 makes sense in this context. What doesn't make sense initially is the lack of improvement on 24H2 for the 285K – until you manually adjust the power plan. After doing so, the performance matched the Core i7-14700K . Unfortunately for Intel, we have to choose a single OS configuration for testing, and there seems to be no perfect option where everything works as it should, at least not at this time. A Plague Tale: Requiem Performance in A Plague Tale: Requiem was disappointing on the 285K, and switching to 24H2 didn't resolve the issue. Oddly, Windows 10 performed poorly in this title, though this was a trend we observed in a few of the 14 games tested. Counter-Strike 2 In Counter-Strike 2, the performance on 23H2 matched what we saw with Windows 10. However, 24H2 was consistently slower, though switching to the high performance power profile provided a small boost. Intel APO Optimization Lastly, it's important to note that all the gaming benchmarks you just saw were run without Intel's APO (Application Optimization) feature enabled. This feature was not enabled by default during our testing, but Intel has indicated that this will be addressed in future BIOS updates. We didn't focus on this for two reasons. First, out of the 14 games we tested, only two – Counter-Strike 2 and Cyberpunk 2077 – support APO. Second, out of curiosity, we went back and enabled APO in those games and found only a 1-2% change in performance, which falls within the margin of error. This suggests that either APO has minimal impact on those titles, or it isn't fully functional yet. We will revisit this feature in future content to see if there are any significant updates or improvements. What We Learned: Inconsistent Gaming Performance So, there we have it – a chaotic mix of results that often don't seem to make much sense. Clearly, Intel has a significant number of issues to resolve, and while we didn't expect them to flawlessly execute a new platform and CPU architecture release, we had hoped for a much more polished product. Depending on the hardware and software configuration, stability can be an issue, though we expect this to be addressed fairly quickly. However, it's something worth keeping in mind. We notified Intel about the poor gaming performance, and while they've offered a few solutions, none have worked to a degree that we find satisfactory. As it stands, gaming performance is inconsistent, to say the least. Overall, this is very disappointing for a next-generation flagship product. If Intel can't make significant improvements, Arrow Lake could end up being a poor choice for gaming. In terms of productivity, the 285K performs better, but it's still not exceptional. While there are certainly workloads where it excels, there are many where its performance is underwhelming compared to the 14900K and 9950X . One area where the 285K has massively improved over the 14900K is power efficiency, which is great news. However, in most cases, it's still far from where it needs to be to truly compete with AMD. The price is also problematic. It's expected to be around $600+, which is far too high. For the same amount, you can get the 9950X or the 7950X3D , and even the 7950X is cheaper at $510 . Any one of those AMD CPUs would be a better choice in our opinion. Even if Intel manages to fully resolve stability issues, fix performance on Windows 11 24H2, and address the inconsistent gaming results, the 285K would still only warrant a price tag of about $500. So, given all that, we're obviously not recommending the Core Ultra 9 285K at this time, and likely won't until these issues are resolved. As for overclocking, given all the current problems and the need to test performance across multiple versions of Windows, we deprioritized overclocking for this initial review. It's something we'll no doubt cover in future content, but for now, it's somewhat irrelevant given the number of issues that need to be addressed first. Memory overclocking is another topic, and while the review kits came with DDR5-8200 CUDIMM memory, it doesn't make much sense due to the extreme price and limited performance gains. We're unsure of the exact cost of this memory, but we know standard UDIMM kits are priced near $300 for a 24GB kit, so the CUDIMM kits will likely be even more expensive. Therefore, something like DDR5-7200 CL34, priced around $115, seems to be a more reasonable option. Once the issues we've discussed are addressed, we'll look into memory scaling to determine the optimal memory support for Arrow Lake. Wrapping this review up, we think there is potential for Arrow Lake to get a lot better as it appears under cooked at this stage. While we strongly recommend not rushing out to buy into Intel's new platform right now, we're not willing to write it off completely just yet.

ryzen 7 7700x,"Continuing with our AMD Zen 4 review tour , this time we're putting the new Ryzen 7 7700X to the test. From a gaming perspective, this is the CPU we've been most interested to examine: it's an 8-core, 16-thread chip using a single CCD, which should mean when it comes to gaming it's going to deliver the best performance. The Ryzen 7 7700X clocks between 4.7 GHz and 5.4 GHz depending on the load, it's composed of a single 5nm core complex die with a 6nm I/O die, packs 32MB of L3 cache, 6MB of L2, DDR5 support, 28 PCIe 5.0 lanes, a 105w TDP, and is designed for AMD's new AM5 platform. This CPU succeeds the Zen 3-based 5800X , which was also an octa-core and featured a launch MSRP of $450. The Ryzen 7 7700X is launching at $400, which is an 11% discount for what should be a much faster processor. Of course, at present the 5800X can be had for as little as $260 , which remains a solid option for those on the AM4 platform that are looking to upgrade. A closer rival in terms of pricing for the 7700X could be the 5800X3D , which currently costs $430, slightly more than the 7700X and that's going to make for a very interesting match up. We have 17 CPUs set up for comparison: for the AM4 platform we have a range of Zen 2 and Zen 3 CPUs, then we've got the Intel 10th-gen Core series including popular Core i5, i7 and i9 models. We have skipped Intel's 11th-gen series and instead focused on 12th-gen Alder Lake with tests using both DDR4-3200 dual-rank CL14 memory and DDR5-6400 single-rank CL32 memory, with models going from the Core i3-12100 up to the Core i9-12900K . The AM5 platform was represented by the MSI MEG X670E Ace motherboard using what AMD said was an ideal RAM setup with DDR5-6000 CL30 memory. All testing was conducted using the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti , Windows 11, and Resizable BAR was enabled for all configurations. Clock Speeds As we've shown with other Zen 4 CPU reviews, here's a look at clock behavior in Cinebench . After an hour of load testing, the 7700X maintained an all-core frequency of 5.1 GHz. This was sustained using the be quiet! Pure Loop 2 FX 360mm liquid cooler installed inside the Silent Base 802 case. For single core workloads the 7700X appeared to maintain a clock frequency of 5.55 GHz, so 150 MHz above the advertised clock frequency. Application Benchmarks In Cinebench R23 we find the 7700X roughly matching the previous generation's 12-core part, the 5900X , coming in just 3% slower. This makes it 13% slower than the 12700K , which can be had for the same price, suggesting that the productivity benchmarks might not be all that smooth sailing for the new 8-core Zen 4 processor. Single-core performance is slightly better than the 12700K, though only ever so slightly, but in terms of single core performance it does make the 7700X one of the best CPUs on the market right now. Performance in 7-Zip is amazing, as has been the case with all Zen 4 processors that we've looked at so far. Here it can be seen beating the 16-core 3950X while coming in behind the previous generation 16-core 5950X by a mere 7% margin, half the cores yet just 7% slower, that's an amazing result. All that said, it was still 8% slower than the 12700K , so despite offering a huge leap forward from the previous generation, it's a little disappointing compared to Alder Lake given the price. AMD's SMT is far more powerful for decompression work and as a result the 7700X crushes the 12700K in this opportunity, offering nearly 20% more performance and matching the Core i9-12900K. The Blender Open Data results place the 7700X alongside the 3900X and 12700K, a great result as it was just 10% slower than the 12-core 5900X. Therefore when compared to its predecessor, the 5800X, the 7700X is 27% faster. The Corona benchmark results are also impressive as the 7700X nudged ahead of the 3900X , 10900K , and beat the 5800X by a 21% margin. Disappointingly, it was 7% slower than the 12700K. That's not a massive margin but given they both cost $400 you'd hope AMD could have beaten what is essentially a year-old competitor at this point. We've seen the Ryzen 9 7950X dominate the Premiere Pro benchmark before and here we can see that the 7700X is just as impressive, beating even the 5950X by a 10% margin and crushing the 12700K by almost 40%. The Photoshop results are splendid. Here the 7700X was 19% faster than the 12700K and 28% faster than the 5800X. This makes it the fastest CPU we've ever tested as it managed to beat even the 7950X. The Ryzen 7 7700X performed well in Adobe After Effects, though it wasn't quite as dominant, only nudging ahead of the 12700K. It was much faster than the 5800X though, offering a little over 30% greater performance. Code compilation performance shows the 7700X doing well again, matching the 12700K depending on the memory configuration used by the Intel Alder Lake CPU. An impressive result that made it 8% faster than the 5900X and a massive 50% faster than the 5800X. Gaming Benchmarks Time for the gaming benchmarks and we'll start with Factorio, which is very cache sensitive and only looks at single core performance. The Ryzen 7 7700X slots right between the 7600X and 7950X making it one of the faster CPUs we've tested in Factorio and around 6% faster than the 12700K, a solid result overall. The 7700X was mighty impressive in Watch Dogs Legion, jumping ahead of the 7600X by a 10% margin and even edging out the 7950X. This placed it roughly on par with the 12900K using DDR5 memory and a massive 30% ahead of the 5800X. It's rare and almost unheard of to see a single CPU generation boost gaming performance by this much, especially given Zen 3 was no slouch. Next we have Rainbow Six Extraction and as we've seen previously with other Zen 4 chips, the 7700X isn't amazing in this title. While this more middle of the pack result looks average, it's worth noting that the 7700X is within 3% of the fastest tested CPU, the 12900K using DDR5 memory, so it's not a bad result at all. The Ryzen 7950X and 7600X results were already impressive in Hitman 3 and with the 7700X we're getting more of the same as it managed to nudge ahead by just a few frames. This did mean that the 7700X was 7% faster than the 12700K using DDR5 memory, not a massive win, but it was impressive to see the Zen 4 CPU come out on top. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is a good representation of how CPU demanding many modern games are. This game can be useful for testing low-end CPUs, but for the 7700X it just shows us that we're able to max out the RTX 3090 Ti here, matching other high-end CPUs. Moving on to F1 22, we see that the 7700X pushes further ahead hitting 343 fps on average making it 18% faster than the 12700K and impressively 7% faster than the 5800X3D. We're also looking at a massive 28% uplift from the 5800X, which is another ~30% generational leap for gaming from AMD. In Spider-Man Remastered results are good despite the fact that the 7700X trails the 12700K by a 5% margin. A bit disappointing in that regard, but when compared to the previous Ryzen generation, it's mighty impressive offering 26% more performance than the 5800X. It appears as though we've reached the limits of the RTX 3090 Ti in Shadow of the Tomb Raider using the highest quality preset at 1080p. Even the 1% lows are no longer improving, at least beyond a frame here and there. Compared to the 12700K, we're looking at a similar average frame rate with a minimal boost to 1% lows. The Zen 4 CPUs have all been impressive in Horizon Zero Dawn and while the 7700X takes out top spot here, it was just 1% faster than the 7600X. The gain over the 5800X wasn't big either, though 12% is nothing to scoff at, but the 20% gain over the 12700K was far more impressive. When compared to the 7600X, the 1% lows of the 7700X are much better in Cyberpunk 2077 and yet despite that it's still much slower than competing Alder Lake parts such as the 12700K, trailing by a notable 10% margin with 153 fps on average opposed to 170 fps. We've seen before how the 5800X3D is a beast in ACC, rushing everything and Zen 4 hasn't changed that, at least not these non-3D V-Cache models. The 7700X trailed the 5800X3D by a 12% margin, though it was still 14% faster than the 12700K. The Riftbreaker isn't too forgiving for Ryzen processors and there appears to be a bug with the dual CCD on the 7950X, which AMD says the developer is looking into. The 7950X should be able to match the 7700X and that would make it one of the fastest CPUs in this title. The 7700X didn't crush the competition, but it was able to pull ahead of the 12700K by a 4% margin which is a solid result considering how uncompetitive Zen 3 is in this title. The Ryzen 7 7700X is very fast in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, taking out top spot, beating even the 7950X. We're looking at an impressive 543 fps, making it a massive 29% faster than the 12700K and almost 50% faster than the 5800X , so that's a stellar result to say the least. 12 Game Average Performance The Ryzen 7 7700X has come out strong in gaming tests as we had expected, taking top spot in our testing, narrowly beating the 12900K using DDR5 memory by a 2% margin. Then when compared to the similarly priced 12700K, it was 6% faster and a massive 21% faster than the previous-gen 5800X . It's encouraging to see that all three Zen 4 CPUs tested so far are faster than the 5800X3D, and that's not something we were expecting to find going into this testing. Power Consumption Here's a quick look at power consumption for an all-core workload. The Ryzen 7 7700X pushed total system power usage slightly higher than the 5900X , but did manage to come in under the 12700K. In a nutshell, the 7700X is not better than either CPU in terms of performance per watt, at least for all core workloads like we see here with Blender. Cooling Performance When it comes to cooling, Zen 4 CPUs give the impression that they're difficult to cool by delivering as much performance as possible by taking full advantage of the thermal and power headroom. AMD says with the new AM5 platform and higher TDP, Zen 4 processors will run into a thermal wall before they hit a power wall. This means under heavy load they'll sit at TJMax which is about 95 degrees Celsius for the Ryzen 7000 series, and this will be particularly true for the 12 and 16-core models. AMD has stressed that this behavior is by design and it's important to note TJMax is the maximum safe operating temperature – not the absolute maximum temperature. AMD went on to say that 95C is not running hot, rather Zen 4 will intentionally go to this temperature under load because the power management system knows that this is the ideal way to squeeze the most performance out of the chip without damaging it. The processors are designed to run at TJMax 24/7 without risk of damage or deterioration they added. On the upside, almost all AM4 coolers will be compatible with AM5, except for those that are secured from the rear side of the motherboard as the backplates aren't removable on AM5 boards. This means that all coolers can be installed without requiring rear access to the motherboard, as is the case with HEDT processors, so that's good news. For testing we used the be quiet! Pure Loop 2 FX 360mm liquid cooler which is fully AM5 compatible. After an hour of looping Cinebench R23 multi-core, we recorded a peak CPU temperature of 97C, just above the 95C TJMax that AMD says the CPU targets for maximum performance. It will be interesting to revisit Zen 4 later using a range of coolers to see how cooling performance affects CPU performance. But that's an investigation for another time. Cost vs. Performance Now lets do a value analysis, starting with the cost per frame of just the CPU. The 7700X is on average only 5% faster than the 7600X , but costs 33% more which makes sense as you are getting 33% more cores. For gaming though that much CPU power isn't required and probably won't be for some time, so the 7700X comes in at a 27% price premium per frame. Still, when compared to competing Intel parts such as the 12700K and 12900K , the 7700X is better value when just looking at the CPU cost. Taking a look at cost per frame while including memory and motherboard costs – which for the DDR4 configurations includes a 32GB kit of DDR4-3200 CL14 memory at a cost of $200, and the DDR5 configurations cost $280, regardless of the spec, both 6000 and 6400 cost the same amount. For the motherboard, the AM5 models are based on the $290 MSI Pro X670-P WiFi, AM4 uses the Asus TUF Gaming X570-Plus WiFi which costs $180, and then the MSI Pro Z690-P DDR4 at $180 and the MSI Pro Z690-A DDR5 at $210. Based on those prices, the 7700X isn't amazing value, but for flagship-tier performance, it still beats out the 12900K while offering similar value to the 12700K. It's also just 6% more costly per frame than the 7600X, making it an attractive option for those seeking ultimate performance. Like the 7600X, the 7700X is weak in terms of value when it comes to core-heavy productivity, both delivering worse value than even the Core i9-12900K. The more expensive Ryzen 9 7950X is worlds better here, so if productivity is the priority then you can ignore 6 and 8-core Zen 4 options. For mixed workloads that rely on strong single and multi-core performance, the 7700X does fare much better and takes out top spot for value in the Premiere Pro benchmark. So when it comes to productivity it will depend on the application, but notice that the 7950X was still faster, so if time's money then that's the way you'd go. What We Learned The Ryzen 7 7700X looks to be the new king of gaming, at least for now, taking out the Core i9-12900K in our 12 game sample. Of course, we'll be keen to compare them head-to-head across 30+ games, and that's something we plan to do soon, though we'll wait for next-gen GPUs before sinking a week into that testing. When compared to existing Intel Alder Lake CPUs for gaming, the 7700X appears to be the superior option from a performance standpoint, while offering a similar level of value to the 12700K , and much better value than the 12900K . That said, if you're prioritizing productivity then the choice between the Alder Lake i7 and i9 parts and the 7700X is less obvious, but in the end it may not matter as you'd just opt for the Ryzen 9 7950X which is much faster, or perhaps the 7900X which we'll be looking at next. Perhaps a more difficult decision for prospective buyers is the choice between the 7600X and 7700X. Right now the 7600X is better value, even when factoring the entire platform cost, but if you're going to build an entire PC from the ground up, the 8-core model will only cost you a few percent more at most, so at that point you might as well part with the $100. On average, the Ryzen 7 7700X is just 3% faster for gaming, though we did see instances where it was up to 11% faster. Realistically, the 7600X is still going to be better value as gaming performance is very similar and this will almost certainly hold true for years to come, just as we've seen in the past. Remember when 8-core CPUs were all the rave for gaming? Remember when 8-core CPUs were all the rave for gaming? If we look at the 12 game sample, which is largely based on modern titles, the Ryzen 7 3700X is on average just 4% faster than the 3600, so even though the older CPUs are significantly slower than newer Zen 4 models, core scaling is remarkably similar. Likewise, the 3950X is just 4% faster than the 3700X, so it's almost guaranteed that within the realistic lifespan of these processors the 7950X won't overtake the 7700X for gaming, say within the next 5 to 8 years. Keeping all of that in mind, the Ryzen 7 7700X is actually our Zen 4 recommendation for gamers. At present AM5 is an expensive platform and if you're faced with having to spend well over $200 on DDR5 memory and the same for an entry-level X670 motherboard, there's little point saving $100 on the 6-core CPU. This recommendation will likely change with the arrival of sub-$200 AMD B650 boards and we've already got a few of those on hand, but are not allowed to show them off yet. DDR5 pricing will almost certainly continue to fall, so in a few months the 7600X should make sense as a sort of AM5 value option. For now though I would overlook it for the 7700X. Which brings us to the conclusion that holding off for a month or two might pay in more ways than you imagine. There's cheaper DDR5 memory at play, but also to see what Intel brings to the table with Raptor Lake, their 13th-gen Core series. It will need to be exceptionally good to overthrow the 7700X and also counter the AM5 platform which will let you upgrade later. A strong argument for spending big on a quality AMD AM5 motherboard now is that you'll still be using it in 2025 and have the option to slot a Zen 6 CPU on there for what should be a massive upgrade. With Intel, on the other hand, you will require a new motherboard in 3 years, a direction we hope they set to change in the generation that comes after Raptor Lake.

ryzen 5 5600x,"It's time we finally check out the Ryzen 5 5600X, the most affordable Ryzen 5000 series processor announced to date. Positioned as a mainstream part, it's coming in at $300, a 20% premium over the Ryzen 5 3600X. However this third-gen processor already didn't make sense as it cost 25% more than the R5 3600 and offered little extra performance. Therefore, most opted for the $200 Ryzen 5 3600 , which is what we widely recommended in the past year as the best value CPU, and that's the part we'll be comparing the 5600X to today. Though we're sure AMD would have preferred we use the 3600X or 3600XT , we'll stick to the more popular vanilla 3600. As a side note, the rumor mill has been churning out reports of a Ryzen 5 5600, a non-X version which might arrive at around $220, just 10% more than the beloved 3600. But we won't know until we know. In the meantime, we've got a somewhat pricey 6-core, 12-thread Ryzen 5600X to check out and we're very keen to see how it compares to not just the Ryzen 5 3600, but also the Ryzen 7 3700X , and how it stacks up against Intel's Core i5-10600K . The 5600X features a single CCD with 6 cores enabled, which means it's limited to a 32MB L3 cache. This is still substantial compared to Intel parts, but it's half of what you get with the 5900X , as that higher-end processor packs two CCDs with 6 cores enabled. The 5600X features a 3.7 GHz base clock with a 4.6 GHz boost clock, very similar clock frequencies to the 8-core 5800X . Ryzen 9 5950X Ryzen 9 5900X Ryzen 7 5800X Ryzen 5 5600X Price $799 $549 $449 $299 Cores / Threads 16/32 12/24 8/16 6/12 Base clock (GHz) 3.4 3.7 3.8 3.7 Boost clock (GHz) 4.9 4.8 4.7 4.6 L2 + L3 Cache 72MB 70MB 36MB 35MB TDP 105W 105W 105W 65W Now it's time to test and then we'll re-evaluate the value of the 5800X towards the end of the review. For testing the AMD CPUs we used the MSI X570 Godlike motherboard along with four 8GB G.Skill TridentZ DDR4-3200 CL14 memory modules for a 32GB capacity. All cooling was handled by the Corsair iCUE H150i Elite Capellix AIO. As we've done with all reviews in this Ryzen 5000 series, all productivity benchmarks were run using the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, but for the gaming tests we upgraded to the more powerful RTX 3090 . Benchmarks Starting with Cinebench R20's multi-core test , we see that the Ryzen 5 5600X is good for 4462 pts or 19% faster than the 3600 and 24% faster than Core i5-10600K. Compared to existing 6-core, 12-thread processors, the performance uplift provided by the 5600X is substantial, so much so that we're very close to 8-core CPU performance. For example, the 5600X is just 9% slower than the Ryzen 7 3700X and 10% slower than the Core i7-10700K , that's a phenomenal result given it packs 25% fewer cores. Given the strong multi-core performance, you won't be surprised to learn that the 5600X is very fast when it comes to single core performance. Here we're looking at a 23% improvement from the 3600 and 18% from the 3700X. In fact, when it comes to single-thread performance the 5600X is faster than even the Core i9-10900K. In terms of clock speeds, we monitored how the 5600X clocks in each of the Cinebench R20 tests. For the multi-core test, where all cores are heavily loaded, the 5600X clocked at around 4.4 GHz, which is well above the advertised 3.7 GHz base clock frequency. AMD also advertises a max boost clock frequency of 4.6 GHz and this should be achieved in single core or lightly threaded workloads. In the Cinebench single core test the 5600X typically operated at 4.65 GHz, that's 50 MHz over the advertised spec. Next up we have 7-zip compression performance and here the 5600X was able to match the 3700X and 10700K, which is a great result and it translates into a 30% performance uplift over the current 6-core/12-thread processors such as the Ryzen 5 3600 and Core i5-10600K. Decompression performance was just as good. Here the 5600X was 7% slower than the 3700X, but 22% faster than the 3600 and a whopping 41% faster than the 10600K. The cryptographic performance of the 5600X is very strong, beating even the 10900K for AES for encryption/decryption. It was 4% slower than the 3700X and 11% faster than the 3600. The performance improvement in Blender is what we've come to expect: we're looking at a 19% uplift over the 3600, making the 5600X 15% slower than the 3700X, which is the biggest margin we've seen yet to the 8-core processor, but even so still an impressive result given it features 25% fewer cores. Once again we see that Zen 3 is a beast in V-Ray as the 5600X comes in just behind the 3700X, losing by a mere 4% and that meant it was 30% faster than the 3600 and 25% faster than the Core i5-10600K. The last rendering benchmark we're going to look at is Corona , and again we find more evidence of the 5600X destroying the 3600, this time by a 28% margin. At that rate, the 5600X was just 6% slower than the 3700X, finding itself situated between the 2nd and 3rd gen 8-core processors. Code compilation performance has been improved by 8% over the 3600. The 5600X was 12% slower than the 3700X here, which is one of it's biggest losses to the older 8-core processor. We're looking at a 6% performance improvement in DaVinci Resolve Studio 16 , so not nearly as impressive as some of the other applications we've tested, but still better than a typical gen on gen improvement. The Premiere Pro results are slightly more favorable for the new 6-core Zen 3 processor as here it was 10% faster than the 3600 and just 3% slower than the 3700X and 10700K. Here we're looking at comparable performance to existing 8-core AMD and Intel processors. The single thread performance of Zen 3 has been massively improved, and we're getting a good look at what that means for single threaded applications like Photoshop. The 5600X was 22% faster that the R5 3600, and 18% faster than the 3700X and 10600K, so that's a huge performance improvement. After Effects is another application that replies predominantly on single core performance and here we see solid performance from the 5600X. At 21% faster than the 3600 and 15% faster than the 3700X, it also easily beat Intel's Core i5-10600K and Core i7-10700K, hell it even beat the 10900K! Power Consumption Like the rest of the Zen 3 range, the Ryzen 5 5600X is exceptionally good in terms of power consumption. We're looking at a 7 watt increase from the 3600, which is excellent considering it's 19% faster in the Blender benchmark. The new CPU also reduced total system consumption by 14% when compared to the 3700X, though that's in line with the performance deficit to that part. When compared to competing Intel parts such as the 10600K, we're looking at massively improved power efficiency. As for operating temperatures, the Ryzen 5 5600X is a very cool running CPU. Peaking at just 63C in our Blender stress test means it's 10C cooler than the 3600X, which is impressive given the similar voltage but almost 500 MHz increase in average clock speed. Gaming Performance Testing with Far Cry New Dawn, we see that the Ryzen 5 5600X is 18% faster than the 3600 and 16% faster than the 3700X. That's a serious performance gain over previous-gen parts. It was also 7% faster than the 10600K and offered better frame time performance. The 5600X also just edged out the 5950X and 5900X as this title doesn't heavily utilize those parts and the lower latency, single CCD design is likely playing a role here. Though we're talking about a negligible 1.5% difference, that's overall exceptionally good performance from the 5600X in Far Cry New Dawn. Next up we have Rainbow Six Siege and we're finding comparable performance to higher-end Zen 3 parts. More than comparable, it's basically identical. The 5600X was 22% faster than the 3600 and 19% faster than the 3700X, a big generational performance gain. The Ryzen 5 5600X is also able to match the 5800X, 5900X and 5950X in the Watch Dogs: Legion. That makes it 23% faster than the 3600, and 15% faster than the 3700X. It also edged out the 10600K by a 5% margin making it the fastest 6-core processor in this title. Moving on to F1 2020, we're again finding similar performance across the Zen 3 range. There's up to a 3% difference between the 5600X and 5950X when looking at the 1% low results. In other words, virtually identical performance and that means the 5600X is 9% faster than the 10600K, 20% faster than the 3700X and 28% faster than the 3600. For the first time in our gaming tests we're seeing the 5600X slip behind the higher core count parts. It wasn't that much slower in Horizon Zero Dawn, trailing the 5950X by up to 10% for the 1% low result and 4% on average. Performance is comparable to the Core i5-10600K, which is 16% faster than the 3700X and almost 30% faster than the 3600. The gains in Borderlands 3 are fairly small compared to most other titles. We're looking at a 7% performance improvement over equivalent Zen 2 parts. The 5600X is comparable to Intel's 10600K in this game, too. Death Stranding can take advantage of higher core counts on the 5900X and 5950X, though it seems to max out with the 5900X. As a result, the 5600X was 11% slower than than the 5900X and 7% slower than the 5800X, though performance was comparable to the 10900K, or at least the average frame rate performance was. When compared to the 10600K, we're looking at a solid 18% performance improvement and a whopping 23% improvement over the 3700X. So here's an example of a core heavy, CPU utilization heavy game that still sees the 5600X obliterate the 3700X. It's also 33% faster than the Ryzen 5 3600. Another CPU demanding game we like to test with is Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Do note we're not using the built-in benchmark, but an open world section that's much more CPU demanding than most other places in the game. SoTR looks to be maxed out with the 5900X. The 5600X was 7% slower that the 12-core CPU and 4% slower than the 5800X and Core i9-10900K. That said, it was 5% faster than the 10700K, 20% faster than the 10600K, 23% faster than the 3700X, and 31% faster than the 3600. Hitman 2 performance is interesting as this isn't a game that benefited from more cores with Zen 2. Clearly memory and cache latency was the primary bottleneck as we do see positive core scaling with Intel processors and now with Zen 3 chips. The Ryzen 5 5600X was able to match the average frame rate of the 5800X, though it was 7% slower for the 1% low result. It also trailed the 5900X by 8% for the average frame rate and 13% for the 1% low. When compared to the 10600K it was 15% faster and then a massive 26% faster than the 3700X and 32% faster than the 3600. Testing with Star Wars: Squadrons shows a ~23% performance boost over the 6 and 8-core Zen 2 processors and a 16% boost over the 10600K. The 5600X's performance output was comparable to the 10900K here. Serious Sam 4 is an NPC heavy title which does benefit from more cores. In this case, the 5800X looks to be the sweet spot as the 5600X was 16% slower, though game time performance was strong and we didn't see any stuttering issues with the 6-core processor. We're also talking about a 26% boost over the 3700X and 16% greater 1% low performance. Gaming Average Here's an overview of the average CPU gaming performance and overall we see a small performance decline when compared to the Ryzen 7 5800X across the 11 games tested. Of course, the margin is very game dependent. When compared to the 8-core 3700X we're looking at a 19% performance boost on average and 24% over the 3600. In other words, the mainstream Ryzen 5 5600X is a much better gaming CPU. It's worth keeping in mind that all tests were conducted at 1080p using a GeForce RTX 3090. Now obviously we do this as the focus is on CPU and not GPU performance, but be aware this isn't typical gaming performance. Normally you'd be using an RTX 3090 at 1440p or 4K gaming: at 1440p you'll be a lot more GPU limited, while at 4K you'll be entirely GPU limited. So don't think an upgrade from the Ryzen 3 3600 to the 5600X will net you around 20% more performance. In the coming weeks we'll likely investigate CPU scaling with a range of GPUs, but for now we're looking more at CPU limited gaming performance. Getting back to the results, it's really impressive to see AMD now offering 11% more performance than Intel's best 6-core processor, the 10600K and we'll look at cost per frame data in a moment, before that though here are the OC results. Overclocking When it comes to manual overclocking we were able to push the Ryzen 5 5600X to 4.6 GHz on all cores. This boosted Cinebench R20's multi-core performance by just 3%, so a fairly pointless overclock. Although we're getting a 3% boost to all core performance, we're also seeing a 1% decline in single core. Blender confirms the all-core gains of 3% for the overclocked 5600X. Not exactly a worthwhile gain and it doesn't help the 5600X catch up to the 3700X here. For that 3% performance boost we're looking at a 4% increase in total system power usage, so hardly anything to worry about. And here's why we don't recommend gamers bother with overclocking the 5600X: we ended up reducing the frame rate in Rainbow Six Siege by 4%. As we've seen before, it does help to improve performance ever so slightly in Far Cry New Dawn, though certainly not to the degree that anyone is going to notice. Price to Performance Here's a look at the price vs. performance ratio using Cinebench R20's multi-core data. At the new $300 price point, the Ryzen 5 5600X isn't exactly great value in core-heavy workloads. While it does match the Ryzen 7 3700X in value, it's also coming in at a 26% premium over the 3600 and that's not great. In order to match the value of the 3600, the 5600X would need to cost no more than $240, so here's to hoping the $220 vanilla version of the 5600 ends up being a thing. Now, the reason the 5600X costs $300 is because of the Core i5-10600K. Compared to Intel's competing part the 5600X is 12% better value. It's a similar situation when we look at Adobe Premiere data: the 5600X stacks up pretty well overall, but is still much worse value than the 3600, coming in at a massive 37% premium. You're also paying a 14% premium over the 3600 for gaming in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, though that's not terrible given the performance improvement, and it's still better value than Intel's 10600K. If we look at the 11 game sample, we see that in terms of value the 5600X and 10600K are comparable. Overall, the new 6-core Ryzen processor is fetching a 21% price premium when compared to the 3600, so that's not great news. What We Learned On one side, it's impressive just how much better the Ryzen 5 5600X is when compared to the 10600K , often offering more value despite costing a little more. On the other side though, it's far less impressive in terms of value when compared to the $200 Ryzen 5 3600. While we do see a number of substantial performance improvements, a 50% price hike is going to be a tough pill to swallow for most. AMD's really competing with themselves: if you want maximum value, get the R5 3600 , if you want maximum performance, get the 5600X and that leaves no room for Intel's Core i5-10600K. It's worth point out that the Ryzen 5 3600 sold really well relative to the 10600K because it was cheaper. And while it is technically slower in games, when gaming you're going to be GPU bound for the most part, and therefore the reality is that gaming performance is very close between those two. This also means gamers will remain better off buying the much cheaper Ryzen 5 3600, or waiting to see if a $220 non-X 5600 becomes a thing in the not too distant future. Speaking of gaming performance, you're no doubt going to hear nonsense such as ""the Ryzen 5 5600X is a poor choice for gamers as it only has 6 cores,"" and they'll probably try and prove that by pointing to the new consoles which feature eight Zen 2 cores. Some people also like to confuse how games and cores work. Making statements like games will require 8 cores or something to that effect. Games don't require a certain number of cores, they never have and they never will. Games require a certain level of CPU performance, it's really that simple. A recent example of that is the Core i5-7600K , or in other words, quad-core processors. Three years ago the 7600K was the best value gaming CPU on the market and it shredded the Ryzen 5 1600 in every game. However, back then we did say that the 7600K's days were counted as games were becoming more demanding and soon 4-cores/4-thread processors would be inadequate, stick with me here... That wasn't because games would necessarily require more than 4 cores, but because there wasn't a single quad-core processor in existence that would be powerful enough to drive the latest and greatest games without avoiding frame stuttering issues and other performance related problems. For example, if the 7600K was capable of out-scoring the Ryzen 5 1600 in Cinebench R20's multi-core test, it would actually be a better gaming CPU today, regardless of how many cores it featured. However, that's not the case. The R5 1600 scores 53% higher in Cinebench and even when overclocking the 7600K to 5 GHz, the Ryzen part is over 30% faster. So, when fully utilized the Ryzen 5 1600 is a more powerful processor, which is why we knew in the not too distant future it would be a better processor for games and that's long since been proven true. However, the Core i7-7700K hasn't yet suffered quite the same fate despite also being a quad-core processor, as it features SMT support for 8 threads. Although it features half as many cores and threads as the Ryzen 7 1700 , it's able to keep up in the latest and greatest games, though it is starting to show some weakness in most demanding titles. At some point, we do expect the R7 1700 to beat the 7700K in games and again if we look at the Cinebench R20 multi-core performance, we see that when fully utilized the Ryzen processor is almost 40% faster and that's obviously a massive difference. But what about the 6-core, 12-thread Ryzen 5 5600X, how will it age? Our guess is extremely well as the massive IPC increase offered by the new Zen 3 architecture means the 5600X is comparable to previous generation 8-core processors such as the 3700X and 10700K, or the Zen 2 parts used in the next gen consoles, and no one expects those processors to become obsolete any time soon. Looking at Cinebench R20 as a rough guide, we see that the 5600X's multi-core performance is just 9% lower than that of the 3700X and 10% lower than the 10700K, and that's not a big difference. It's also worth noting that you need to be cautious when using Cinebench to measure heavy CPU utilized gaming performance. We use it to observe how CPUs might compare when fully utilized in games, but Cinebench isn't particularly memory sensitive, so a CPU like the 5600X which is much improved compared to the 3700X in terms of cache and memory latency, will perform better in games under heavy load than the Cinebench R20 score would suggest. The memory and cache latency improvements of the Ryzen 5 5600X means that there's a good chance it will never end up being slower than the 3700X in games. Doesn't matter if you're talking average frame rates or frame time performance, it should be better by all metrics. If you have the option of the Ryzen 5 5600X or the 3700X for $300, you should absolutely get the 5600X in our opinion. It's a lot better right now in games and we expect that still be the case in a few years' time. Or save your money and get the R5 3600 as it still gets the most out of high-end GPUs at 1440p, or if you can wait for the Ryzen 5 5600.
