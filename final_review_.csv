0,Ryzen 9 9950X3D," The new 16-core/32-thread Ryzen 9 9950X3D we are reviewing today, and its 12-core/24-thread sibling, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D, are based on a dual-CCD variant of the Granite Ridge-X package, and is powered by the AMD Zen 5 microarchitecture with 3D V-Cache technology. Much like the Ryzen 9 7000X3D series, stacked 3D V-Cache memory is only present on the first 8-core CCD, while the other is a regular one with just the 32 MB on-die L3 cache. AMD continues to rely on software level OS scheduler optimizations to ensure that gaming workloads are scheduled to the CCD with 3D V-Cache, while multithreaded productivity workloads are allowed to spread evenly among the two CCDs. The company released an update to AMD Chipset Software with a couple of new features that improve software-based scheduling compared to how it was with the Ryzen 9 7000X3D series at launch. 3D V-Cache technology has been the most impactful hardware-level innovation by AMD in recent times, which established the company as the makers of the world's fastest processors for PC gaming for the past three generations of processors. The Ryzen 7 5800X3D was able to match the gaming performance of the Intel Core i9-12900K despite being based on the generation older Zen 3 microarchitecture with slower DDR4 memory. The Ryzen 7 7800X3D dominated gaming performance over both the 13th- and 14th Gen Core Raptor Lake generations, remaining faster than even the latest Core Ultra 200 Arrow Lake. AMD likely anticipated a generational leap in single-threaded performance from the Lion Cove P-core powering the Arrow Lake, and began designing 3D V-Cache variants of its Zen 5 microarchitecture, which it debuted with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D last November, extending the company's gaming performance leadership. AMD's Ryzen 9000 series powered by the Zen 5 microarchitecture launched back in August 2024, and it was a bit of a disappointment in the gaming performance front, with the Ryzen 7 9700X 8-core processor falling short of the gaming performance of the 7800X3D. The company continued to sell the 7800X3D at its launch price to maintain gaming performance leadership, which endured Intel's Arrow Lake launch. Much to AMD's relief, the 9800X3D was able to extend its gaming performance leadership, thanks to significant increases in clock speeds on top of the modest generational IPC increases posted by Zen 5. Besides increased clock speeds, AMD pulled off a major engineering feat that ensures its Ryzen 9000X3D chips offer superior thermals to the Ryzen 7000X3D series, and overclocking capabilities. With Zen 5, AMD inverted the way the CPU complex die (CCD) and 3D V-Cache die (L3D) are stacked. On older generations of X3D processors, the CCD would have the L3D stacked on top of it, over the central region that has the on-die 32 MB L3 cache, while structural silicon stacked over the edges of the CCD leveled the L3D. This structural silicon carried with it the crucial task of conducting heat generated from the CPU cores up to the surface, where it's transferred via soldered TIM to the copper IHS, and then onward to the CPU cooler. With Zen 5, AMD inverted this—the CCD is now on top, with the L3D below it. With the CCD on top, the CPU cores directly dissipate heat to the cooling solution over STIM, with no structural silicon in the way, which means it could now have the same thermal and overclocking characteristics as non-X3D processor models. The L3D is peppered with through-silicon vias (TSVs), which connect the CCD to the package substrate below. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D is designed to offer the gaming performance advantage of 3D V-Cache to the segment of the desktop PC market that wants a large core-count that's not large enough to warrant a workstation processor like the Ryzen Threadripper or the Xeon W. It comes with a core-count of 16-core/32-thread, all of which are full-size Zen 5 cores, and what Intel would classify as ""performance cores."" Subject to software-level OS scheduler optimizations, threads can migrate between the CCD with the 3D V-Cache and the one without, since the CPU core types and their ISA are identical. The 9950X3D offers clock speeds of 4.30 GHz base, with up to 5.70 GHz boost. It comes with 144 MB of ""total cache,"" which AMD defines as the sum of all L2 and L3 caches on the package. AMD has given the 9950X3D its highest power headroom, and a TDP of 170 W, along with 230 W package power tracking (PPT). The processor is compatible with all Socket AM5 motherboards, support on AMD 600-series chipset motherboards requires a BIOS update, and while the processor is drop-in compatible with AMD 800-series chipset motherboards, using the latest BIOS update is highly recommended. In any case, almost all Socket AM5 motherboards come with the USB BIOS Flashback feature, which lets you update BIOS even without a compatible processor installed. AMD is pricing the Ryzen 9 9950X3D at $700, which positions it above Intel's flagship, the Core Ultra 9 285K. Just like the other Ryzen 9 processors, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is a chiplet-based processor, with two 8-core Zen 5 chiplets. The 9800X3D, 9700X and 9600X only have one chiplet. This modularity gives AMD finer control over the die size needed to achieve a given core count. Why 8 cores per chiplet? AMD probably can't go more than 80 mm² per chiplet. The smaller the die, the more yields per wafer, so 8 cores seems like an even break. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D launching today, are the second wave of processors from the 9000X3D family that combine the new Zen 5 microarchitecture with 3D V-Cache technology. The 9000X3D series debuts the second generation of 3D V-Cache technology. In past generations of X3D chips, such as the Zen 3-based 5800X3D and the Zen 4-based 7800X3D, the 64 MB 3D V-Cache die (L3D) was stacked on top of the CPU complex die (CCD), over its central region that has the 32 MB on-die cache, with structural silicon being installed over the two ends of the CCD that have the CPU cores. These pieces of structural silicon would handle the all-important task of transferring heat from the CPU cores to the cooling solution above. With the second generation of 3D V-Cache technology, AMD has inverted the way the L3D and CCD stack up. The Zen 5 CCD is now stacked on top of the L3D using TSMC's direct copper-to-copper die bonding technology. Heat from the CCD now dissipates to the cooling solution like on regular Ryzen 9000 series processors. The L3D, on the other hand, is now a sort of base tile, spanning the entire area underneath the CCD. Its central region has the 64 MB L3 cache, while the entire tile is peppered with TSVs (through-silicon vias) that connect the CCD above to the fiberglass substrate below. This design change not only vastly improves thermals for the CCD, but also makes it possible for these chips to have the same overclocking capabilities as regular Ryzen 9000 series processors, such as the 9950X. The AMD Ryzen 9000 series desktop processors, including the 9800X3D, 9950X, 9900X, 9700X, 9600X, and the 9950X3D and 9900X3D, are based on the new Granite Ridge chiplet-based solution. The CPU complex dies (CCDs) are where all the innovation is focussed, as this is where the Zen 5 CPU cores are located. The rest of the processor is made up of the client I/O die (cIOD), which is carried over from the previous generation, so AMD could save on development costs. AMD built the new-generation CCD on the 4 nm TSMC N4P foundry node, an upgrade from the 5 nm TSMC N5 node, with over 22% power improvement, and 6% transistor density improvements. The CCDs are roughly the same size as the Zen 4 CCDs, and fit in nicely with the substrate floor-plan of the Granite Ridge package. AMD has retained the CPU core counts of its previous generation, the company continues to not be baited into a core-count war with Intel, triggered by its pivot to heterogeneous multicore and tiny E-cores of which it can cram many of into its processors. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D is the company's flagship part for this generation, and is a 16-core/32-thread chip, with two CCDs. The 9900X3D is 12-core/24-thread, with two CCDs, and two cores disabled per CCD. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is a single CCD part. The Zen 5 Core With the I/O and packaging aspects of Granite Ridge covered by carrying over the cIOD and existing Socket AM5 infrastructure, all of AMD's engineering attention is on the 4 nm CCD, specifically the Zen 5 CPU cores, since there's not much else on the CCD besides them. It's been AMD's endeavor to give consumers single-thread performance improvements in the form of an IPC uplift, with each new generation of Zen. These generational IPC increases range between 10-19%, and with Zen 5, the company wants you to expect roughly 16% better IPC over Zen 4. AMD designed the Zen 5 core to be ""forward-facing"" with support for instruction sets that will become more relevant with the advent of AI acceleration into the client space. While the Granite Ridge processor itself lacks an NPU and won't accelerate Copilot+, the Zen 5 cores are designed to improve the working experience of AI software developers and researchers, besides machines that use discrete accelerators, since the CPU-end (software end) of the AI stack can benefit from new capabilities on the cores. With Zen 5, AMD has updated practically all key areas of the CPU core, including the front-end with its branch prediction unit, the various caches within the core, the fetch/decode pipelines, the execution engine, and the load/store. The front-end sees an updated branch prediction unit. This new BP ensures zero-bubble conditional branches to save clock cycles from mispredictions; a large 16 KB L1 BTB, and a larger tagged-geometric length predictor; a larger 52-entry return address stack, compared to 32-entry on Zen 4; a 16-way Op Cache associativity, compared to 12-way on Zen 4, and a 33% increase in Op Cache and dispatch bandwidth. The BP supports up to 3 prediction windows per cycle, compared to 2 on Zen 4. The L2 and tablewalker latency is obscured with the new aggressive fetch unit. The L2 ITLB supports 2,048 entries, compared to just 512 on the Zen 4 core. The L1 instruction cache gets bandwidth and latency improvements, along with two independent instruction fetch streams. As with every traditional x86 CPU core, there's a split into Integer and Floating Point units. The Integer engine features an 8-wide dispatch/retire/rename queue depth. The integer scheduler has more ""symmetry"" to simplify pick operations. It features 6 ALUs with 3 multipliers, and 3 branch units; besides 4 AGUs. The AGU scheduler supports 56 entries, and the ALU scheduler 88, compared to 3x 24-entry ALU+AGU combined scheduling, with a 24-entry dedicated ALU scheduler. The physical register file is up to 240/192 entries from 224/126 on Zen 4. The ROB retire queue buffer holds 448 entries, compared to 320 on Zen 4. The floating point unit is where Zen 5 seems to have a major design focus. Zen 5 is designed to execute AVX-512 instructions over a full 512-bit data-path, compared to Zen 4, which uses a dual-pumped 256-bit data-path. This should significantly speed up AVX-512, VNNI, and other instructions relevant to AI acceleration on the CPU core. The FPU has four execution pipelines with two LS/integer register pipes. It supports two 512-bit loads, one 512-bit store per cycle, and a 2-cycle FADD. There are updates to the FPU's execution window. The load/store unit sees several improvements to meet the growth in bandwidth requirements of the execution engine. To begin with, the L1 data cache has been enlarged to 48 KB 12-way, up from 32 KB 8-way on Zen 4. Besides this enlargement, there are improvements to the load/store pipes, with a mix of 4 loads and 2 stores per cycle. Its four integer load pipes can pair into FP pipe. The bandwidth to the L2 cache has been improved. The core's dedicated L2 cache remains 1 MB in size from the previous generation, but AMD says that it has doubled the associativity and bandwidth of this cache over the one Zen 4 comes with. While AMD has retained 32 MB as the standard on-die L3 cache size, which it shares among the 8 cores on the CCD, it has worked to reduce the cache's latency along with tracking up to 320 L3 in-flight misses. Granite Ridge SoC Features Depending on the processor model, the chip features one or two CCDs, each with eight Zen 5 cores, 32 MB of L3 cache, an SMU, and an Infinity Fabric interface, with 32 B/cycle read and 16 B/cycle write bandwidth, to the client I/O die (cIOD). The cIOD uses Infinity Fabric to connect all the various SoC components of the processor, the two most important of which are the dual-channel DDR5 memory controllers  (160-bit including ECC), and the 28-lane PCI-Express 5.0 root complex. AMD provides a basic iGPU with Granite Ridge, just like it did with Raphael. This is based on the older RDNA 2 graphics architecture due to reusing the cIOD from Zen 4, and consists of just one workgroup processor (WGP), or just two compute units (CU), worth 128 stream processors. This iGPU talks to a display controller that supports up to four displays; and a multimedia engine that can accelerate decode of H.265 and AV1. There's also an integrated USB interface, with support for USB 3.2 (up to two 10 Gbps ports), a couple of USB 2.0 ports, and legacy interfaces, including SPI, eSPI, GPIO, I2C, etc. The client I/O die is built on the 6 nm foundry node, as many of these components don't really benefit from the latest 4 nm node. The cIOD of Granite Ridge is carried over from Raphael, with only some microcode updates that give it native support for DDR5-5600 (Ryzen 7000 natively supported DDR5-5200), various overclocking speeds over AMD EXPO, and support for higher DDR5 overclocking memory speeds using a 1:2 divider between the FCLK and MCLK. AMD Chipset Software Updates Alongside the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D processor launches, AMD is releasing an update to its Chipset Software—a collection of drivers for its chipset and processor SoC components, which optimize the software environment to best make use of the dual-CCD layout of these chips. Not only do the 9950X3D and 9900X3D have two CCDs, but also the cache sizes of the two CCDs differ. Only the first CCD has 3D V-Cache memory, which makes up 96 MB of L3 cache; while the other is a regular Zen 5 CCD with just the 32 MB on-die cache. Unlike Intel with its hardware-based Thread Director solution, AMD relies on software to optimize workloads to these processors, ensuring that less parallelized gaming workloads are confined to the CCD with 3D V-Cache, while multithreaded productivity workloads scale normally. AMD introduced the ability for Chipset Software to detect a change in processor, such as an upgrade from an older processor to the 9950X3D, and install the relevant components. Earlier this wasn't the case, and Ryzen 9 X3D processors such as the 7950X3D would run suboptimally until Chipset Software reinstallation. AMD Application Compatibility Database defines software and games with a high degree of awareness of the way CPU cores and L3 caches are arranged on the Ryzen 9 9950X3D processor, and optimized games tend to offer significantly higher performance. AMD X870E, X870, B850, and B840 Chipsets Along with the Ryzen 9000 Granite Ridge series, AMD introduced their 800 series desktop motherboard chipset family. The processors are placed in the existing Socket AM5, and as such are compatible with any AMD 600-series chipset motherboard with a BIOS update. Helping things along is the fact that nearly every AM5 motherboard comes with USB BIOS Flashback, which should let you blind-flash your BIOS even if you have an ""incompatible"" processor. AMD hasn't changed the I/O of its processors, as we detailed on the previous page, but identified the reasons why some of its 600-series chipset models were vastly outselling the others. Market studies showed that enthusiasts are drawn to the top X670E, and the rest of the crowd to the well-rounded B650, with no takers for the X670 and B650E. AMD set out to correct these by shuffling up the feature-sets among its 800-series chipset models, while also using the occasion to standardize a few I/O features, such as USB4, and encouraging its motherboard partners to provide new connectivity options, such as Wi-Fi 7. The AMD X870E chipset leads the pack in terms of connectivity. It is a dual-chip solution, much like X670E and X670. You are assured PCI-Express Gen 5 for the x16 PEG slot, as well as the CPU-attached NVMe slots; while the chipset puts out up to 16 Gen 4 PCIe lanes. Also, motherboard designers are mandated to provide 40 Gbps USB4 connectivity. The X870 (non-E) is a lite version of this chipset, and is a single-chip solution, much like the B650E. You'll still get PCI-Express Gen 5 x16 for the PEG slot, as well as Gen 5 for the CPU-attached NVMe slots, however the chipset only puts out 8 Gen 4 PCIe lanes for general purpose I/O. Much like X870E, with X870 you are assured of USB4 connectivity. The B850 is a successor of the B650. It is a single-chip solution just like X870, but here, motherboard vendors are allowed to wire out the PCI-Express x16 PEG slot as Gen 4. The CPU-attached NVMe interfaces, however, should remain Gen 5 capable. Motherboard vendors can still provide Gen 5 x16 PEG if they want to, but it's optional. USB4 isn't mandatory, so a vendor can design an X870 motherboard and simply pull out the USB4 interface to label the board as B850. Like X870E and X870, the B850 chipset supports both CPU and memory overclocking. Lastly, there's the B840, an entry-level chipset meant to succeed the A620 and A620A. The PCI-Express x16 PEG runs at a primitive Gen 3 speed. The chipset puts out just 8 Gen 3 lanes. There's no CPU overclocking support, only memory. The B840 should hence power the vast majority of entry-level or commercial desktop motherboards. Overclocking Curve Shaper is a new feature being introduced with Ryzen 9000 series processors. It's part of the AMD CBS, which means it can be configured in the UEFI setup program, should the motherboard vendor choose to have a GUI there, or using Ryzen Master on Windows. Curve Optimizer enabled PBO and PMF-aware under-volting, while Curve Shaper lets end-users reshape the underlying voltage curves to fine tune voltage control across different workloads and frequencies. A side effect of giving processor models such as the 9900X (120 W), 9700X (65 W), and 9600X lower TDP than their predecessors, the 7900X (170 W), and 7700X (105 W), is that Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) now scoops out more performance, as it raises the package power for the processors. AMD claims further performance gains of 6% for the 9900X, and up to 15% for the 9700X (which goes to show that 65 W is quite conservative for this SKU). Native DDR5 support has been increased to DDR5-5600, and support has been added for overclocked memory as fast as DDR5-8000. To achieve this, a 1:2 clock divider is engaged between FCLK and MCLK as soon as memory clock is set higher than DDR5-6000. You may manually force a 1:1 divider ""and with some luck"" you will be able to run DDR5-6400—essentially the same as with Zen 4. DDR5-8000 support has been released by AMD through an update to the AGESA microcode, for motherboard vendors to integrate with even their older AMD 600-series chipset products. There should be a new wave of enthusiast PC memory with AMD EXPO profiles for DDR5-8000 and everything under (such as DDR5-7200, DDR5-6800, etc.). In terms of performance it is interesting to see if DDR5-8000 1:2 can beat DDR5-6000 1:1 in a wide range of scenarios, which could make it a worthwhile investment. TPU has tested Zen 5 memory scaling in a separate article . Socket AM5 Here are a few pictures of Socket AM5, the star-attraction with this platform. This is a land-grid array (LGA) socket with 1,718 pins. As with every LGA socket, the pins are on the motherboard, whereas the processor package has contacts that interface with those pins, while a retention brace holds the package in place with a locking lever. Installing a processor on AM5 is similar to doing so on any of the dozens of Intel LGA sockets. On Socket AM4, removing the four mounting screws resulted in the backplate falling off, which meant you needed three hands when installing a cooler, and several vendors also bundled their own backplates. On Socket AM5 the backplate isn't designed to be removed, which makes cooler installation MUCH easier. The caps for the socket are not identical to the Intel LGA sockets, so you can't reuse them. Unboxing and Photography The Ryzen 9 9950X3D comes in a square-shaped box, similar to the other Ryzen 9000 series chips. There's no included cooling solution. The box-art is a slight variation on the theme set by the regular Ryzen 9000 series chips, the AMD arrow is now set against a silver backdrop instead of gray. There's clear marking on the front and back faces that the processor features 3D V-Cache technology. The Ryzen 9000 Series looks just like the previous Ryzen 7000 Socket AM5 processors. While there are some minimal changes to the SMD capacitor layout, these aren't significant in any way. The AM5 socket retention brace only applies pressure along the two side protrusions of the IHS. Intel sockets have it the same way. Socket AM5 retains cooler compatibility with AM4, so you're spoiled for choice with aftermarket cooling solutions. Test Setup All applications, games, and processors are tested with the drivers and hardware listed below—no performance results were recycled between test systems. All games and applications are tested using the same version. All games are set to their highest quality setting unless indicated otherwise.

Among the benchmarks are versions built with React, Ember.js, AngularJS, vue.js, jQuery and others—frameworks that are used by the most popular sites in the world. AI Inference — GPT2 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have enabled us to create applications that are almost magical in their abilities. GPT-2 is a powerful language model developed by OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, that excels at generating human-quality text. It's a key AI workload because it tests the efficiency and capability of AI systems in handling complex language tasks, which is crucial for many real-world applications. We are measuring the time it takes to generate 100 stories starting with the ""Once upon a time, there was a"" prompt. AI Inference — Stable Diffusion Stable Diffusion stands out as the second rock star AI workload. This cutting-edge image generation model creates high-quality, detailed visuals from textual descriptions. Its ability to produce realistic images has wide-ranging implications for industries such as art, design, advertising, and media, enabling innovative content creation and enhancing visual storytelling. We are timing how long it takes to generate a single image for the prompt ""a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on Mars."" AI / Inference — Image Upscaling Topaz Photo AI is a premier tool for AI-driven image processing. It enhances image resolution and quality by intelligently increasing detail and reducing noise. This advanced capability improves the clarity and sharpness of assets, making it a valuable tool for anyone needing high-resolution images. Our test reports how long it takes to upscale a 1.5 megapixel image to 22 megapixels. AI Training — Natural Language Processing Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves training AI models in understanding and generating human language. By applying algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret text data, NLP enables tasks like translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation. We are measuring how long it takes to train a BERT language model with a collection of movie critic reviews. AI Training — Image Classification Image classification is a crucial AI workload because recognizing objects within images is essential for many practical applications, including autonomous driving, facial recognition, medical imaging, and inventory management. This process involves using algorithms to analyze and extract features from images. During training, these methods learn patterns and attributes from labeled datasets. Our test involves training a model with several thousand images to classify photos of clothing into categories such as ""T-Shirt,"" ""Bag,"" and ""Pullover."" Sony PS3 Emulator RPCS3 is a popular PlayStation 3 emulator for PCs, which let you play many Sony PS3 titles on your favorite platform. The emulator has serious hardware requirements, and some of its emulation threads constantly need to communicate with each other, which makes it a tough workload for many CPU architectures. RPCS3 also benefits from faster cache and memory speeds, when available. AVX-512 is enabled where supported, including Zen 4 and Zen 5. Nintendo Switch Emulator Ryujinx is a highly compatible, feature-rich emulator for the Nintendo Switch console. It relies heavily on your CPU, and also comes with some tricks how to use the memory management unit (MMU) of your processor to handle the emulated environment. While it is multithreaded, higher single-core performance is more important than being able to scale to many cores. Rendering — Cinebench Cinebench is one of the most popular modern CPU benchmarks because it is built around the renderer of Maxon's Cinema 4D software. Both AMD and Intel have been showing this performance test at various public events, making it almost an industry standard. Using Cinebench 2024, we test both single-threaded and multithreaded performance. Rendering — Blender Blender is one of the few professional-grade rendering programs out there that is both free and open source. That fact alone helped build a strong community around the software, making it a highly popular benchmark program due to its ease of use as well. For our testing, we're using the Blender ""BMW 27"" benchmark scene with Blender 4.3. Rendering — Corona Corona Renderer is a modern photorealistic renderer that's available for Autodesk 3ds Max and Cinema 4D. It delivers physically plausible and predictable output due to its realistic lighting algorithm, global illumination, and beautiful materials. Corona does not support GPU rendering, so CPU performance is very important for all its users. We do not use the horribly outdated Corona Benchmark tool, which doesn't support new architectures, instead using the much newer version 12. Rendering — KeyShot The standalone KeyShot rendering software features fast and efficient workflows that help you get realistic high-quality product shots in the shortest possible time frame. Real-time ray tracing, multicore photon mapping, adaptive material sampling, and a dynamic lighting core provide high-quality images that update instantly even when interactively working on the scene. KeyShot 2024 is optimized for usage on both CPUs and GPUs. We use the CPU renderer because the GPU renderer still has some limitations in terms of rendering capability. Rendering — V-Ray V-Ray is a world-leading 3D rendering software that uses global illumination, path tracing, photon mapping, and irradiance maps to achieve super-realistic render output. It has been used for CG in countless motion pictures and television series. V-Ray supports all major 3D applications, which makes it a great fit for any rendering pipeline. In this test, we're using the V-Ray 6 benchmark tool in CPU-only mode to get the number of ""vsamples"" that can be processed on a given hardware. Higher is better. Game Development — Unreal Engine 5 Unreal Engine 5 is the leading multi-platform game engine in the industry. Not only advanced, it also has lots of features to help you get results quicker than with competing products—time is money. The latest version 5 adds several new features that make the engine not only suitable for gaming, but also for architecture, automotive and movie production. Before a game is shipped, there is a lengthy process called ""build, cook and package,"" which optimizes the various assets, compiling and compressing them into versions that will work best on the target platform, before packaging them into optimized bundles ready for distribution. We use a relatively simple scene—usually this process takes several hours. Software Development - Git Source Code Management In software development, a version control system (VCS) is essential for tracking changes and managing files, enabling developers to record updates, revert to previous versions, compare changes, and work together efficiently. Git, a distributed version control system, takes this further by allowing each contributor to have a complete copy of the project history, facilitating offline work and robust collaboration. While Git usually operates quickly, certain tasks, such as repository optimization and data management, can be computationally intensive. Our test measures the time it takes to complete a set of such operations. Software Development — Visual Studio C++ Microsoft Visual C++ is probably the most popular programming language for creating professional Windows applications. It's part of Microsoft's Visual Studio development suite, which has a long history and is widely accepted as the gold standard when it comes to IDEs. Compiling software is a relatively lengthy process that turns program code into the final executable, and programmers hate waiting for it to complete. We run a medium-sized application through the Visual Studio 2022 C++ compiler and linker, and use the resource compiler, too. The build is executed in ""release"" mode with all optimizations turned on and multiprocessor compilation enabled. Software Development — React Javascript React is a popular JavaScript library for building dynamic UIs—not just for the web, but also for mobile and desktop. Once you are ready to ship your product, a bundling process is executed to transpile JSX, minify code, and apply tree-shaking for smaller download sizes. Our React compile benchmark, builds a medium-sized React app using a popular bundler, measuring the total build time. The build runs in production mode with all optimizations enabled to reflect real-world deployment conditions. Media Encoding — AV1 Nowadays, all video that is consumed, whether on TV, physical media, or streamed over the internet, is compressed using various codecs. AV1 is a next-generation video codec that is open and royalty-free, unlike other recent new video compression algorithms. Major industry players like YouTube, Netflix, and Facebook stand behind AV1 and are gradually rolling out support for the new format. Compared to older algorithms, such as H.264, the compression rate is much better, or you can achieve higher image quality for a given bitrate. We use the SVT-AV1 encoder with a 4K video source to compress to AV1. Media Encoding — H.265 / HEVC Our second video-encoding test uses the H.265 codec, which is also known as HEVC. Compared to H.264 it provides superior compression efficiency, reducing file sizes and bandwidth usage while maintaining high video quality. We compress a 4K video using the latest version of the X265 encoder with 8-bit color depth, preset ""slow,"" and a quality setting of crf 20. Media Encoding — H.264 / AVC H.264, also called AVC, is a slightly older compression format, though probably the most widely used these days because it is well-supported, even on older hardware. We compress the same video as in the H.265 test using the X264 encoding software, with the preset ""slower"" and crf 20. Media Encoding — MP3 MP3 revolutionized the music industry like no other technology. Introduced in the 90s, it enabled a massive reduction in audio-file sizes, without noticeable impact on sound quality. This made music downloads, and ultimately streaming, a feasible method for content delivery over the Internet. Our benchmark converts a 2.5 hour-long 44.1 kHz Stereo recording to a variable bitrate MP3 file. MP3 encoding is a single-threaded process. Microsoft Office Microsoft's Office suite needs no introduction as it's probably the most widely used PC software on the planet, installed on every office computer no matter the industry. Our tests cover a wide range of editing and creation tasks in Word, PowerPoint, Excel and Outlook. Image Editing — Adobe Photoshop Adobe Photoshop has become the industry standard for photo and image processing. We run Photoshop 2024 through a battery of typical editing tasks, like image resize, various blurs, sharpening, color and light adjustments, and image export. We also apply more complex actions like content-aware fill, lens correction, smart sharpen, select subject, and tilt shift. Video Editing — Adobe Premiere Pro Adobe Premiere Pro is the workhorse of the video production industry for creating high-quality content for film, TV, and the web. It can handle pretty much every recorded file format and supports workflows for editing Full HD, 4K, 8K, and virtual reality content. Unfortunately, most of Premiere Pro is single-threaded, and media encoding is highly GPU accelerated, so benchmarking ""export"" on the CPU makes little sense. For our testing, we're using the software's ""object tracking"" functionality, which automatically scans through a video to follow a specific person or object—this task does indeed use more than a single core, but doesn't fully scale. A lot of memory is consumed and accessed in the process, over 10 GB for our test scene. Video Production — Adobe After Effects While Premiere Pro is optimized for cutting, arranging and editing videos, Adobe After Effects is the industry standard for creating motion graphics, text rendering, color correction and other visual effects like outlines, explosions etc. When applied, each of these takes up a little bit of CPU time, so when there's many of them, processing duration will increase quite a bit. We're measuring the time it takes to export a short intro trailer, including music and sound. Create 3D Model from Photos Creating 3D models is a tedious and complex task that takes time and requires experienced artists. It's thus the holy grail of 3D modeling to reconstruct a 3D model from just a series of photos. That's exactly what Photogrammetry does. This method is also used to reconstruct terrain geometry from photos taken by aerial drones. Blackmagic RAW 6K Video Decode Blackmagic RAW (BRAW) is a high-performance codec designed for professional video production it offers excellent image quality and variable compression rates. As performance test we measure the framerate while decoding a 2.3 GB BRAW 6K 8:1 video file on the CPU. Physics Simulation COMSOL is the gold standard for the accurate simulation of physics effects and one of the strongest competitors to Ansys. Where the software shines is in solving multiphysics problems that depend on several phenomena—you can simulate everything, including black holes. The modular aspect of COMSOL helps professionals customize the software to their desires, which can be run with a single module or a whole multitude of collaborating modules for more demanding tasks, as well as with two-way communication with external programs, such as CAD software. Chemistry Simulation NAMD is developed by the University of Illinois and helps researchers simulate the dynamic interactions between molecules and atoms. It is an established means of molecular dynamics simulation that scales from individual clusters of molecules to full-on chemical interaction in different phases. Parallel simulation modes help differentiate NAMD from its peers, allowing efficient problem-solving of larger systems using the Charm++ parallel programming model as the base. Medical Science — Genome Analysis COVID-19 has shown the world that deadly pandemics can bring society to a standstill. Computational genomics is essential for rapid development of vaccine candidates in a race against time. In this test we're running an analysis on a set of genomes to determine which individuals in the dataset share common traits in their DNA. This is not only a compute-intensive workload, but it also uses quite a lot of memory (over 10 GB), which makes it dependent on the performance of the memory subsystem. Antivirus Scan Securing your system against viruses and malware is essential for reliable operation. Antivirus software detects unwanted programs by comparing files to a large database with thousands of signatures and rules. In this test we're measuring how long it takes to scan all files of a 30 GB game. Altium PCB Designer Altium Designer has been used to make at least one of the circuit boards inside your favorite piece of electronics. It's an industry-leading solution to build complex PCBs by automating circuit paths and ensuring that signal integrity and design rules are followed in the design. Our test measures how long it takes for Altium PCB Designer to load a project, run various operations on it, including autorouting, design rule check and finally releasing the whole design to manufacturing. Text Recognition OCR — Google Tesseract Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is the task of turning text in scanned images or photos into actual characters for archival, further processing, or editing. While most OCR software is single-threaded, Google's Tesseract engine can operate on multiple pages of a scanned document at once, spreading the load over several processor cores. The software, which is considered one of the most accurate open-source OCR packages available, automatically runs a spellcheck on the initial recognition results, which adds to the complexity of the workload. Virtualization — Oracle VirtualBox A virtual machine is a simulated computer inside your computer that's completely independent of the host PC. This not only improves security, but also enables software written for different operating systems to execute on one physical machine. Virtualization is the foundation for ""the cloud"" and helps reduce hardware ownership cost by dynamically spreading out virtual machines over multiple computers to make the best use of available hardware resources. We're testing VM performance using Oracle's VM VirtualBox software, with hardware virtualization support enabled for both Intel and AMD processors. Curiously, many motherboards ship with the virtualization setting disabled by default, so we made absolutely certain we had enabled it. Database — MySQL More data is stored and processed today than ever before in human history. Database systems that manage storage and retrieval throughout large data sets are the backbone for this revolution. Whenever you interact with a website or other digital service, one database is almost always guaranteed to be involved in returning the results you are looking for. We benchmark the most popular database system, MySQL, in the TPC-C test, which simulates many warehouses and their constantly changing inventory. The reported number is ""transactions per second,"" so higher is better. Database — NoSQL While traditional relational databases are the industry standard for a lot of workloads, NoSQL databases use a different, non-tabular approach, which offers tremendous speedups for certain workloads. That's why they are used in many big data and real-time web applications today. We benchmark how long it takes MongoDB to complete 10 million requests. Java The Java programming language is designed to be platform independent, highly scalable, and fault-tolerant, which is why it's very popular for enterprise services that work with lots of data and many concurrent users. Our test suite consists of a large mix of individual Java benchmarks, some of them single-threaded, some that scale somewhat, and some that fully scale to as many cores as are available. Web Hosting People don't like excessive load times in their browser, which makes handling all the incoming requests of a busy website in a timely manner a non-trivial task that can potentially overload some server systems. In our web server benchmark we're recording how long it takes an ASP.NET Core 9 based content management system to process a million requests to its ""about us"" page. Our benchmark uses an in-memory mock database to not be bottlenecked by the backing database engine. Compression — WinRAR Data is compressed almost all the time when it moves over the wire to reduce download time and transfer sizes. WinRAR uses a more advanced compression algorithm than classic ZIP, which is why we chose it for this test. It's also able to scale across multiple processor cores. Compression — 7-Zip Another popular compression software is 7-Zip, which includes a benchmark that measures the integer instruction rate (MIPS) using the ZIP algorithm. It makes good use of multiple threads, when available. Encryption — AES Encryption is the foundation for secure communication on the internet. The AES encryption standard is one of the most popular encryption algorithm these days because of its simplicity and resistance to attacks. Unlike other encryption methods, AES is symmetric, which means the same key is used for encrypting and decrypting data. Being able to quickly encrypt and decrypt information is important, which is the reason why modern processors have an instruction set extension called ""AES-NI"" that accelerates these operations. Encryption — SHA3 ""SHA"" is technically not encryption, but hashing. A cryptographic hash function is a mathematical algorithm that creates a fingerprint value for existing data. This is a one-way function, which is practically impossible to invert. Another requirement for a good hashing algorithm is that you can't create a collision: craft a message that yields a specific hash value. The SHA3 algorithm achieves all that and is also often used to authenticate transmitted data which possibly was encrypted with AES first. Game Tests: 720p On popular demand from comments over the past several CPU reviews, we are including game tests at 720p (1280x720 pixels) resolution. All games from our CPU test suite are put through 720p using a RTX 5090 graphics card and Ultra settings. This low resolution serves to highlight theoretical CPU performance, because games are extremely CPU-limited at this resolution. Of course, nobody buys a PC with an RTX 5090 to game at 720p, but the results are of academic value because a CPU that can't do 144 frames per second at 720p will never reach that mark at higher resolutions. So, these numbers could interest high-refresh-rate gaming PC builders with fast monitors. Our 720p tests hence serve as synthetic tests in that they are not real world (720p isn't a real-world PC-gaming resolution anymore) even though the game tests themselves are not synthetic (they're real games, not 3D benchmarks). Individual Benchmark Scores Gaming with Ray Tracing Game Tests 1080p Individual Benchmark Scores Gaming with Ray Tracing Game Tests 1440p Individual Benchmark Scores Gaming with Ray Tracing Game Tests 4K Individual Benchmark Scores Gaming with Ray Tracing Minimum FPS While average FPS is the most useful metric to tell you the typical experience during gameplay, minimum FPS will tell you what's happening in worst-cases, like during intense battles or other demanding situations. All results on this page report the 1% Low FPS, or 99th percentile. Per definition these results are based on a smaller set of data for each benchmark run, which makes the numbers more unpredictable, so the uncertainties are higher than in our normal average FPS data. You may look at all the individual test runs by clicking the button at the end of the page. Individual Benchmark Scores Show Per-Game Results Application Power Consumption All power measurements on this page are based on a physical measurement of the voltage, current and power flowing through the 8-pin EPS CPU power connector(s), which makes them ""CPU only,"" not ""full system."" We're not using the software sensors inside the processor, as these can be quite inaccurate and will vary between manufacturers. All measurements are collected and processed at a rate of 30 data points per second, on a separate machine, so the power measurement does not affect the tested system in any way. Our new data processing pipeline allows us to link recorded data precisely with benchmark runs, so we can easily create the charts below. Gaming Power Consumption Idle Power Usage Idle power usage is important for assessing energy efficiency, too. It reveals the power consumed when the system isn't actively in use—which is often the case for many computers. Unlike our other measurements, which report ""CPU power only,"" these results are measured at the wall socket (230 V AC). The system is configured as detailed in the Test Setup section, i.e. with one SSD and one discrete graphics card installed. Energy Efficiency Just looking at power draw in watts won't paint the whole picture for any given processor. It's not only important how much power is consumed, but also how quickly a task is completed—taking both into account results in ""efficiency."" Since a faster processor will complete a given workload quicker, the total amount of energy used might end up less than on a low-powered processor, which might draw less power, but will also take longer to finish the test. In this section, we divide the performance achieved by the power usage, to get a Cinebench points per watt single-threaded and multithreaded result. For gaming (with GeForce RTX 5090) we divide the average FPS of all our games by the power consumed, for a frames-per-watt rating. All these tests are based on our CPU-only power measurements, not whole system. Power vs Core i9-14900K Power vs Ryzen 9 9950X Power vs Ryzen 7 9800X3D Temperatures We're using a Noctua NH-D15 for temperature measurements. Application temperatures are measured using Blender, a highly demanding rendering load, which will load all cores completely, but that's still realistic and is not a synthetic stress test such as Prime95. For gaming, we picked Cyberpunk 2077, its modern engine is multi-thread aware and will try to spread as many tasks as possible over many CPU cores, when available. Even when a game uses multiple threads it doesn't load each CPU core as heavily as rendering, for example, so there's some scope for power savings here. Note that unless indicated otherwise, all processors are tested at stock conditions with their power limit active, which is why some Intel temperatures are surprisingly low. As designed by Intel, these CPUs can exceed their TDP for a few seconds (PL2), but in the long term, the power limit (PL1) is respected, which brings temperatures down considerably. Both tests report the steady-state temperature after an extended runtime of at least 10 minutes. Temperatures are based on delta T, normalized to 25°C, that's why the temperature of some CPUs is higher than their throttle point, because the room temperature was below 25°C. For recent Intel CPUs we've increased the temperature limit in BIOS from 100/105°C to 115°C, to get a better feel for temperatures without thermal throttling getting in the way. AMD Zen 4 and Zen 5 CPUs have their thermal target set to 95°C, which means the CPU will boost as much as it can, until it reaches that point, to maximize performance. Unlike on Intel, on AMD's AM5 platform it's not possible to increase the 95°C limit. Temperature testing on this page uses air-cooling, for consistency and to show comparable results. All performance testing on the other pages is done using an Arctic Cooling Liquid Freezer III liquid cooling solution that keeps temperatures well below all limits, to ensure there is no thermal throttling. Clock Frequencies The following chart shows how well the processor sustains its clock frequency and which boost clock speeds are achieved at various thread counts. This test uses a custom-coded application that mimics real-life performance—it is not a stress test like Prime95. Modern processors change their clocking behavior depending on the type of load, which is why we provide three plots with classic floating point math, SSE SIMD code, and modern AVX vector instructions. Each of the three test runs calculates the same result using the same algorithm, just with a different CPU instruction set. Nice, a gradual reduction of frequencies as load increases. Please note that the cores with 3D V-Cache are clocked a bit lower than the cores without cache. That's why we tested the cores without cache first for the low-threaded results. The rated 5.7 GHz is reached only with a single non-cache core loaded, and the typical operating frequency is closer to 5.5 GHz or so. Overclocking While overclocking was disabled on previous X3D processors, this is fully supported on the 9950X3D. One important development for this ability is that AMD has now placed the 3D V-Cache tile under the CCD with the CPU cores, instead of on top of it. This improves thermals, because heat doesn't have to travel through the X3D's cache silicon anymore. As previous reviews have shown, the right way to overclock these processors is by using AMD Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO): Set PBO mode to ""manual"" Then, I removed all the power and current limits I also set +200 MHz with a scalar of x10 Last but not least, I set Curve Optimizer to -10 all cores That turned out to be fully stable, so I set -15, -20 and -25 with quick stability testing at each setting At -30 the CPU was unstable, so I settled for -25 The benchmark charts include a full run at this setting (blue bar) Performance Summary On this page, we're comparing the performance of the processors in our test group by showing their relative performance as a percentage. The charts highlight how each CPU stacks up against the others in our testing. Using percentages makes it easy to see which processors excel or lag in the benchmarks, with higher percentages indicating better relative performance. Performance per Dollar Below, we're plotting how much processing power you get for each dollar spent on various processors across our full suite of application benchmarks and non-gaming workloads. This comparison shows the value of each CPU by relating its performance in tasks like video editing, 3D rendering, or data processing to its cost. A higher value means you get more capability for your money, making that processor a better choice for handling demanding applications. Cost per Frame The following charts show how much you're expected to pay for each frame that's rendered, focusing only on the processor cost and ignoring power usage or other hardware expenses. It's important to consider both the reported cost per frame and the actual framerate you're getting. At higher resolutions, FPS differences between processors are smaller because the GPU becomes the bottleneck. The FPS numbers are based on the ""Average FPS"" results at a given resolution, combining performance data from all our game tests, both with and without ray tracing. Performance vs Ryzen 9 9950X Performance vs Ryzen 7 9800X3D Performance vs Core i9-14900K Performance vs Core Ultra 9 285K Performance vs Ryzen 9 7950X3D Value and Conclusion The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D will sell for $700 Fastest productivity processor in the world Faster in gaming than any other non-X3D CPU Good energy efficiency Overclocking unlocked Runs on existing Socket AM5 motherboards Integrated GPU Full-speed AVX-512 support No risk of E-Cores complicating software compatibility ECC support (depending on motherboard) High price Higher gaming power consumption than 9800X3D Some setup/verification required for optimum performance (Microsoft Game Bar) No NPU for AI acceleration Technology & Positioning With the 9800X3D AMD introduced their first Zen 5 X3D processor in November last year, and it has already reached legendary status as one of the best processors ever made. While its gaming performance is stellar, it does lag behind when it comes to highly demanding productivity workloads. At CES Las Vegas, in January, AMD confirmed that 3D V-Cache is coming to Ryzen 9, too. Today we have for you the review of the new flagship, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, which is a mighty 16-core/32-thread processor using a Dual CCD design. One of the chiplets integrates an additional silicon die with 64 MB of 3D V-Cache, while the other chiplet is able to run higher frequencies, because it can run a more aggressive voltage-frequency curve. The increased cache capacity makes it possible to keep important data right inside the CPU. As a result, costly trips to the main memory can be avoided. This provides a significant performance boost, depending on the application of course. Test Setup With our 2025 CPU Test System we've updated all games and applications to the newest version and added two more productivity tests, which brings the total number of app tests to 50. We're also using Windows 11 24H2 and made big changes to the list of games, adding the newest titles into the test suite. Just like before we do run both with and without ray tracing enabled, as that affects performance scaling significantly, due to the higher GPU load, which pushes the bottleneck away from the CPU. One of the highlights is that we're now using an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, which is also the reason why the number of comparison CPUs is so low, it simply takes a long time to build that much benchmark data, this review will be updated as new results become available. Last but not least, the memory speeds have been set to DDR5-6000 CL28 for all processors. I did ask our community whether it would be more fair to run AMD at 6000 CL28, for example, and Intel at higher frequency, but slower latency, like DDR5-7600 CL38, but a consensus was not found, so I opted for the less complicated option—DDR5-6000 CL28 for all. Application Performance Application performance of the 9950X3D is fantastic, it even beats the 9950X, which is somewhat unexpected. While it's no surprise that some applications will benefit from the extra cache, we're seeing higher performance across the board in virtually every single test. Taking a closer look at the typical clock frequencies of both processors reveals that on average, the 9950X3D does clock higher than the 9950X. Partly responsible for that is the fact that energy efficiency is a little bit better on the X3D version, or it could simply be that these cores are binned better. Still, this means you won't have to decide ""do I focus on applications and prefer the 9950X, or focus on gaming, so I should pick the 9950X3D?""—No, the 9950X3D will give you the best performance, period—as long as you can afford it. Compared to the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K, the performance uplift is around 7%, and against the 14900K the improvement is 13%. This confirms once again, that AMD is the leader in the processor space, not only for gaming, but for applications, too. While the 9800X3D is fantastic for gaming, it does fall back in application workloads, especially tasks that scale to a lot of cores run A LOT faster on the 9950X3D, but the processor is more expensive, too, of course. AMD also has support for the AVX512 instruction set, which is beneficial for a handful of specialized applications, but a total non-issue for the general consumer. Intel on the other hand has introduced an NPU for AI acceleration with Arrow Lake, which is missing on Zen 5 desktop processors. That's not a problem either, because at the moment most AI experiences are cloud-based or run on the CPU/GPU. Gaming Performance Gaming performance of the 9950X3D is impressive—it beats every single processor on the market, the only exception is the 9800X3D. At 1080p Full HD, which is of course an unrealistic resolution for the RTX 5090, AMD's newest release is almost 10% faster on average than the 9950X without 3D V-Cache. If you look at individual games, which benefit from the larger cache, the differences are even bigger. The 9950X3D is also around 10% faster than the 14900K and 22% faster than the 285K. Last generation's Ryzen 7 7800X3D is still a strong option that's just 3% slower than the 9950X3D. Once you are playing at 4K though, the bottleneck shifts from the CPU to the GPU, which means the differences between all processors get compressed a lot. Here we see only around 10% between the entries in our test group, which isn't that much. If you don't have to own the best, and want to smartly manage your budget, it might make sense to opt for a more affordable CPU and spend the savings on a faster graphics card, where you are getting more FPS for your money. Integrated Graphics While the RDNA 2 integrated graphics are not a main selling point of the Ryzen 9950X3D it is still nice to have this option, and it offers good performance for all non-gaming tasks. You'll be able to run all productivity, office, web browsing and media playback apps easily. From a technical perspective, this is the same iGPU as on Ryzen 7000 and 9000 processors, because AMD is using the same IO die, where the iGPU lives. In gaming, the iGPU performance is identical to that of the Ryzen 7000. The added 3D V-Cache doesn't make any difference for iGPU performance. AMD has always made it clear that the iGPU is not for serious gaming, so no complaints here. Power Consumption Just like the 9950X, the 9950X3D is designed with a TDP of 170 W, which makes a lot of sense, in this segment people don't want compromises due to TDP, and they are open to other cooling methods, like watercooling. Overall power consumption of the 9950X3D is quite reasonable, reaching 130 W on average in applications, with the top workloads hitting 200 W. In gaming, the power consumption is pretty high tough with 144 W on average, which roughly matches what we've been seeing on 9950X (142 W) and 14900K (140 W). Compared to the 9800X3D, which uses only 75 W, the power draw is almost twice as high. No doubt, the dual CCD design increases power, but I didn't expect to be that much. While energy efficiency is improved over the 14900K, no doubt, it's similar to other Ryzen 9 processors, not nearly as good as what we've seen on the Ryzen 7 models, which use a single CCD. Cooling Requirements When AMD designed Socket AM5, they wanted to ensure cooler compatibility with Socket AM4, which means a thicker IHS had to be used, which made cooling more difficult. AMD is also using a 95°C thermal limit, at which the processor will reduce frequency to avoid overheating. Intel raised their limit to 105°C with Arrow Lake, manual tuning allows 115°C, which simplifies cooling greatly, and it's all covered under warranty. I'm happy to report that cooling the 9950X3D is pretty easy. Even with air cooling you'll be able to stay under 95°C, even at full load. Even with a weaker heatsink or when focusing on a quiet system you'll be fine, and it might make sense to allow a little bit of thermal throttling in the most demanding applications at 95°C—Zen 5 is designed to operate at that temperature 24/7 for the lifetime of the processor, so don't worry. Overclocking Overclocking the previous X3D processors was locked, you could mess around with BCLK or PBO to gain a few percent, also memory clocks and timings, but your options were limited. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D on the other hand is fully unlocked—you get pretty much the same dials of the other Zen 5 processors. When using PBO to improve the processor's boosting behavior the gains weren't massive, 3% in apps, 1% in gaming, but it's still tempting enough for tweakers to play around with. Platform The Ryzen 9950X3D will run great on any AM5 motherboard, even the most affordable ones—there's no reason to pay the absurd prices of some X870E boards. The only thing you have to confirm is that the VRM can provide 170 W, which should be possible on a majority of options available. Like all other Zen 5 processors, the ideal memory configuration is 6000 1:1, or perhaps 6200 1:1. Spending extra on high-frequency DDR5 memory isn't worthwhile because the processor will require an additional divider for these speeds, which slightly diminishes performance, offsetting any advantages from the higher frequency. You should rather focus on low timings. I'm happy to report that the boot times on AM5 have been improved significantly with the latest BIOS versions and are a total non-issue now. It only takes a few seconds, even after power has been disconnected for a while. Good job, AMD! Software Requirements Just like on previous dual-CCD processors, you have to jump through some software hoops for optimum performance. The processor itself isn't able to decide whether a workload should run on the CCDs with extra cache, or the one with higher frequency. Windows isn't of any help either, so AMD decided to hook into Microsoft's Game Bar for game detection. This means that you must install Game Bar, make sure it has the latest game library update, enable Game Mode and hope that everything works correctly. While there is a manual ""remember, this is a game"" override, I find all this much too complicated for the average Joe. I'm also surprised that AMD hasn't built a software component that's part of the chipset driver that notifies you when everything is set up properly and warns when there are issues. Ideally with ""ignore,"" ""remind me later,"" ""I know what I'm doing"" choices, so that it doesn't get in your way all the time. Pricing & Alternatives AMD wants $700 for the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, which is a hefty price tag—making it the most expensive desktop processor on the market. In return, you get the best application performance, the second-best gaming performance. I still find that investment hard to justify. If your main focus is gaming, then you should definitely opt for the 9800X3D, even the 7800X3D is ""close enough."" If your main focus is applications, then you might be able to find a good deal on a 14900K, which currently sells for $450. Intel's Arrow Lake 285K is too expensive for what it offers. If gaming is not a priority for you, then the 9950X could align well with your workloads, saving $150 in the process. Today, AMD has also launched the Ryzen 9 9900X3D, which sells for $600. I'll try to get a review sample, so we can find out whether its 12c/24t core-configuration offers a good compromise for gaming and productivity with a lower budget. Upcoming Releases Intel's Arrow Lake CPUs have been launched, both K and non-K. Maybe they'll release a KS model, but I doubt that it will bring any significant gains over their existing offerings. AMD's Zen 6 seems to be one more year away. Intel Panther Lake, aka Core Ultra 300 Series is expected to launch at the end of 2025, but that will probably be mobile only. There have been whispers about an Arrow Lake refresh, which could allow Intel to tackle the performance shortcomings observed in certain cases. Although Arrow Lake possesses impressive raw power, it hasn't been effectively converting that into optimal FPS figures for gaming and related workloads—or they canceled it and are focusing on their next-gen, which would be ""Beast Lake,"" expected for 2026. In conclusion, AMD has reinforced its dominance in the CPU market with the 9950X3D, and it appears that no competitor will soon be able to challenge that position in the near future. Our awards explainedFour months have passed since the release of AMD's impressive Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU, and it seems the market still can't get enough of it. Supply has been reasonable, but demand has been overwhelming. And because this is yet another in-demand product built using TSMC's N4 process, the 9800X3D is fighting for supply with countless other sought-after chips. As a result, even today, the 9800X3D is often out of stock and difficult to purchase at MSRP. We should mention that when we were writing this Newegg had it in stock for $480 and it was their number one best-selling CPU. The reason for its extreme popularity is simple – the 9800X3D is the world's fastest gaming processor, without exception, and at $480, it is affordable compared to even a basic graphics card. The only downside is that it isn't particularly strong in productivity workloads. For those who need both work and gaming performance, alternatives like the 7950X3D or Core Ultra 9 285K have been better choices. That changes today with the release of the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, along with its sidekick, the 9900X3D. The 9950X3D is a 16-core/32-thread Zen 4-based processor featuring two 8-core CCDs, one of which is equipped with AMD's 3D V-Cache technology. It is priced at $700 – the same MSRP as the previous generation 7950X3D. Meanwhile, the 12-core/24-thread 9900X3D is set to launch at $600, again matching the MSRP of its predecessor. Ryzen 9 9950X3D Ryzen 9 9950X Ryzen 9 9900X3D Ryzen 9 9900X Price (MSRP) $700 $650 $600 $500 Release Date March 12, 2025 Aug 15, 2024 March 12, 2025 Aug 15, 2024 Cores / Threads 16 / 32 12 / 24 Base Clock 4.3 GHz 4.4 GHz Boost Clock 5.7 GHz 5.5 GHz 5.6 GHz L3 Cache (Total) 128 MB 64 MB 128 MB 64 MB Box Cooler N/A Chiplets 2 x CCD, 1 x I/O Core Config 2 x 8 TDP 170 W 120 W We have heard that initial supply for these new CPUs is quite good, particularly for high-end models. However, as was the case with the 9800X3D , it's unlikely there will be enough supply to meet demand, so getting one will likely be a challenge, at least for the next month or so. AMD has only sent out the 9950X3D for review, and frankly, it's the only part that truly makes sense. The 9900X3D is just 16% cheaper than the 9950X3D yet has 25% fewer cores, making it a poor value proposition. Worse still, only six cores have direct access to the larger 3D V-Cache, making it less effective for gaming. In a way, it's essentially an overpriced 6-core processor. Unless the 9900X3D is offered at a 30% discount relative to the 9950X3D, it isn't worth considering. This is likely why AMD has opted not to send it out for review. It may seem odd that these Zen 4, dual-CCD 3D V-Cache processors are only being released now – four months after the 9800X3D. Supply constraints could be a factor, but another possibility is that AMD has been refining scheduling optimizations to prevent the 9950X3D from falling behind the 9800X3D in certain games due to improper CCD usage or excessive cross-CCD communication. To improve performance and ensure better scheduling, AMD has updated its Provisioning Packages Service and 3D V-Cache Performance Optimizer. Additionally, AMD is introducing a new Application Compatibility Database. The Provisioning Packages Service is a significant update, as it eliminates the need to reinstall Windows for a new Ryzen processor to function correctly. However, AMD still recommends a fresh install. The service monitors the system, and if it detects a change in CPU name, core count, logical processor count, or L3 cache size, it will automatically uninstall and reinstall the necessary drivers. This service is designed to optimize CPU power and performance for dual-CCD processors when gaming. It achieves this through a combination of power and frequency adjustments, along with core parking while using the Windows Game Mode power profile. These optimizations may be dynamically applied to specific power profiles, typically when launching an application. When the operating system detects that a game is running, it ""parks"" the cores on the non-3D V-Cache-enabled CCD, making those cores temporarily unavailable to the OS. Then there's the AMD 3D V-Cache Performance Optimizer, which enhances the performance of Ryzen 9 3D V-Cache processors for both gaming and non-gaming tasks by dynamically adjusting the favored processor cores based on the active application. When gaming, the operating system prioritizes cores connected to the larger L3 cache. Conversely, for non-gaming tasks, it prioritizes the highest-frequency cores. Unlike the Provisioning Packages Service, this software does not park cores. Finally, there's the AMD Application Compatibility Database, which requires both a new BIOS and chipset driver. This database is designed to address problematic games that cannot be fully optimized through the Provisioning Packages and supports all dual-CCD models. Currently, it includes optimizations for Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, Dying Light 2, Far Cry 6 , Metro Exodus , Total War: Three Kingdoms, Total War: Warhammer III, and Wolfenstein: Youngblood. So a lot of effort has gone into ensuring that, when it comes to gaming, the 9950X3D performs just as well as the 9800X3D. We look forward to testing this claim with the 12 games in our day-one reviews and later exploring it further with a 40 – 50-game benchmark. For now though let's go over the data we have… Test System Specs CPU Motherboard Memory AMD Ryzen 9000 Series AMD Ryzen 7000 Series Gigabyte X670E Aorus Master [BIOS F34b] G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 32GB DDR5-6000 CL30-38-38-96 Windows 11 24H2 AMD Ryzen 5000 Series MSI MPG X570S Carbon MAX WiFi [BIOS 7D52v1B1] G.Skill Ripjaws V Series 32GB DDR4-3600 CL14-15-15-35 Windows 11 24H2 Intel Core Ultra 200S Asus ROG Maximus Z890 Hero [BIOS 1501] G.Skill Trident Z5 CK 32GB DDR5-8200 CL40-52-52-131 Windows 11 23H2 [24H2 = Slower] Intel 12th, 13th & 14th MSI MPG Z790 Carbon WiFi [BIOS 7D89v1E] G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 32GB DDR5-7200 CL34-45-45-115 Windows 11 23H2 [24H2 = Slower] Graphics Card Power Supply Storage Asus ROG Strix RTX 4090 OC Edition Kolink Regulator Gold ATX 3.0 1200W TeamGroup T-Force Cardea A440 M.2 PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD 4TB GeForce Game Ready Driver 572.70 WHQL CPU Clock Behavior (Stock, PBO, Eco Mode) First, let's take a look at how the 9950X3D behaves out of the box with nothing more than EXPO settings applied. After half an hour of looping Cinebench's multi-core test, we recorded an average core clock frequency of 5,085 MHz and a peak CPU temperature of 84°C. These results were recorded in an ATX case using a 360mm AIO. To enable PBO, we did this manually in the BIOS and benchmarked this configuration, which you will see in the following graphs. Using the advanced PBO options, the PPT, TDC, and EDC were all manually maxed out, the PBO scalar was set to 10X, the boost clock override was set to +200 MHz, and the curve optimizer was set to -20. Under these conditions, we saw an average clock frequency of 5,227 MHz, a mere 3% frequency increase over stock. However, because we used a negative curve optimizer, the peak CPU temperature dropped from 84°C to just 78°C, as the average package power dropped from 193W down to 186W. Finally, we also benchmarked the 9950X3D using Eco mode, which reduced the all-core frequency by almost 30% to 3,633 MHz. As a result, we saw a peak CPU temperature of just 61°C with a package power of only 88W. Productivity Benchmarks Cinebench 2024, Multi Core Now, let's look at Cinebench multi-core performance. Out of the box, the 9950X3D scored 2,448 points, making it 4% faster than the standard 9950X in our testing. However, to be fully transparent, we have not had a chance to update our 9950X data with the latest chipset drivers. When compared to the 285K , the 9950X3D was just 3% slower, and our 285K data is up to date. It's also worth noting that when compared to the 9800X3D, we observed a 77% performance boost. Manually enabling max PBO resulted in only a small 3% increase, while the power-efficient Eco mode reduced performance by 25%. We will examine power consumption shortly. Cinebench 2024, Single Core As for single-core performance, it remains the same as what we previously observed from the 9950X, scoring 141 points. The same performance was achieved using PBO, while the Eco mode resulted in just a one-point drop. When compared to the 285K, the 9950X3D was 6% slower. Cinebench 2024, Power Consumption When it comes to power consumption, we measured 229W across the EPS12V rails, the same power draw as the 9950X and 7950X. Thanks to a negative offset, PBO slightly reduced power consumption. The Eco mode, which also led to a 25% performance reduction, managed to cut power consumption by almost 60%, making it significantly more power-efficient. It's impressive that, for the same power draw as the 9600X, the 9950X3D delivers 87% more performance in this test. 7-Zip File Manager Compression Next, we have the 7-Zip File Manager Compression test, where the 9950X3D leads, outperforming the 7950X3D by 7% and the 9950X by 15%. This performance margin is similar to what we saw between the 9700X and 9800X3D. Even when using Eco mode, the 9950X3D still matched the 9950X, making it just 4% slower than the 285K while sipping power. 7-Zip File Manager Decompression For decompression performance, the 9950X3D is comparable to the 9950X and 7950X, making it 31% faster than the 285K. Even in Eco mode, the 9950X3D was just 2% slower than the 285K, so AMD is crushing Intel in this workload. Blender Open Data Moving on to the Blender results, the 9950X3D once again tops the charts, coming in just 4% faster than both the 285K and 9950X. Enabling Eco mode kills performance, dropping the samples per minute to 202 – an almost 30% reduction from stock. However, this is still roughly twice the performance of the 9600X for a similar power draw. Corona 10 Benchmark The 9950X3D also tops the charts in Corona , beating Intel's 285K by a 13% margin and the previous generation 7950X by 20%. Enabling max PBO only provided an additional 4% boost, but it still resulted in the best performance we have seen from a mainstream platform to date. Adobe Photoshop 2025 Photoshop does not take full advantage of high-core-count CPUs, so the 9950X3D does not offer much improvement over the 9800X3D. In fact, out of the box, it was slightly slower. However, compared to the 285K, the 9950X3D was nearly 20% faster, making for a significant performance advantage. Adobe Premiere Pro 2024 Premiere Pro benefits more from higher core counts but not to the same extent as 3D rendering tests. The 9950X3D was 5% slower than the 285K but matched the 14900K when running in low-power Eco mode. Gaming Benchmarks Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Time for the gaming benchmarks, and we'll start with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Here, the 9950X3D was able to match the 9800X3D, which is a great result, though really to be expected given the 7950X3D matched the 7800X3D. This points to the 9950X3D being a significantly better all-rounder, especially for those who also want high-end gaming performance from a workstation, as the 9950X3D is 52% faster than the 285K here. The 7950X3D and 7800X3D were also comparable in The Last of Us Part 1, and the same is true of the 9950X3D and 9800X3D, with the dual-CCD Zen 4 part allowing for 210 fps, making it just 7% faster than the 285K in this example. Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Now, the Cyberpunk 2077 results are interesting. Here, the 9950X3D allowed for 216 fps, making it just 1% slower than the 9800X3D, so in other words, performance was much the same. That's a great result because the 7950X3D is 8% slower than the 7800X3D here, and we've seen a bit of this in the past, where the dual-CCD model can be anywhere from a bit slower to a lot slower for gaming, and AMD has been working to solve this. Assetto Corsa Competizione Scheduling issues weren't a problem for the 7950X3D in Assetto Corsa Competizione, as we can see it matched the 7800X3D. The same is true of the 9950X3D, which was able to match – or even slightly nudge ahead of – the 9800X3D, delivering chart-topping results. This also meant that the 9950X3D was an insane 77% faster than the 285K in this game. Remnant II Remnant II is another game where we previously didn't see any scheduling issues, so the 9950X3D performed as expected, delivering a few more frames than the 9800X3D, making it 33% faster than the 285K. Homeworld 3 The 9950X3D was a beast in Homeworld 3, despite slipping behind the 9800X3D by a small 4% margin. That's an excellent result given the 7950X3D was a massive 25% slower than the 7800X3D. This also meant that the 9950X3D was 52% faster than Intel's 285K. A Plague Tale: Requiem The 7950X3D had some frame pacing issues in A Plague Tale: Requiem, and as a result, it ended up trailing the 7800X3D by a 6% margin when comparing the average frame rate and 20% slower for the 1% lows. The 9950X3D, on the other hand, behaves like the 9800X3D, delivering the same excellent performance, making it 58% faster than the 285K. By the way, we went back and re-tested the 285K, and sadly, in cases like this where performance is horrible, Intel has been unable to improve the situation. Counter-Strike 2 The 7950X3D was only slightly slower than the 7800X3D in Counter-Strike 2, but whatever the issue was, it has been cleared up with the 9950X3D, which matched the 9800X3D almost exactly. This also made it 29% faster than the 285K. Starfield The previous-generation CPUs didn't suffer any major scheduling issues in Starfield , so unsurprisingly, the 9950X3D performs like a 9800X3D here, making it 11% faster than the 285K. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Next up, we have Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 , and here, the 9950X3D is delivering 9800X3D-like performance, which is great news as the 7950X3D was 10% slower than the 7800X3D in this title. This also means that, compared to the 285K, the 9950X3D is 25% faster. Hitman 3 The Hitman 3 results are really surprising because here, the 9950X3D is actually 6% faster than the 9800X3D, allowing for 306 fps – a 14% boost over the 285K. That's also a great result, as the 7950X3D was 4% slower than the 7800X3D. Watch Dogs: Legion Finally, we have Watch Dogs: Legion, and here, the 9950X3D was 3% faster than the 9800X3D, making it a massive 39% faster than the 285K. Overall, excellent gaming performance from the 9950X3D. Power Consumption When Gaming Cyberpunk 2077 Now, when it comes to power consumption, the 9950X3D consumed 44% more power than the 9800X3D in Cyberpunk 2077 , matching the 12900K and consuming just 8% less power than the 285K. But let's look at power efficiency when factoring in the resulting fps performance. Cyberpunk 2077 - Watt per Frame Here, we can see that in terms of power efficiency, the 9950X3D is comparable to the 9600X and 7600X, making it 35% more power-efficient than the 285K in this example. Still, it was 48% less efficient than the 9800X3D, though that gap was reduced to 17% when using Eco mode. The Last of Us Part 1 Measuring power usage in The Last of Us Part 1 saw the 9950X3D consume 32% more power than the 9800X3D but 14% less than the 285K. So, let's see how that works out when calculating efficiency. The Last of Us Part 1 - Watt per Frame The 9950X3D is comparable to the 5800X3D or 7600X when it comes to power efficiency, making it around 30% less efficient than the 9800X3D and 37% less efficient than the 7950X3D. Still, when compared to the 285K, we're looking at an almost 20% improvement in efficiency. Performance Summary Here's the 12-game average data, and no surprises – the 9950X3D is a beast, taking the top spot and delivering essentially the same performance as the class-leading 9800X3D. Even in Eco mode, it was on average 8% faster than the 7800X3D and 31% faster than the 285K. Overall, we're only looking at a 1.4% performance boost from PBO, at least across the games we tested, but this did improve power efficiency, so it might be worth considering. That said, the overall performance is outstanding and remarkably consistent for a dual-CCD processor – AMD has finally nailed it. X3D Turbo Mode: Enabled vs Disabled Gigabyte made a big deal out of X3D Turbo Mode when they first introduced it in their BIOS, making bold claims about performance gains. At the time, no one really knew what it did. Since then, we've learned that it's a mostly useless feature that few would actually use. In short, this mode disables the second CCD entirely, along with SMT support, reducing a processor like the 9950X3D from a 16-core/32-thread CPU down to an 8-core/8-thread one. Gigabyte also tweaks some memory timings for better gaming performance. The idea is to ensure that games run on the CCD with the 3D V-Cache while disabling SMT, which can sometimes negatively impact gaming performance. However, our testing indicates that leaving SMT enabled is generally beneficial for gaming. The biggest issue with this feature is that it can only be enabled at the BIOS level, meaning the system must be completely reset every time you want to toggle it on or off. It's not something you can quickly and easily switch within Windows before launching a game. If a toggle option were available, this would be an incredibly useful and practical feature. With X3D Turbo Mode enabled, we saw a 3% improvement on average across the dozen games tested, with notable gains in titles like Homeworld 3 and Space Marine 2. However, there were also significant performance drops in other games, such as Starfield and The Last of Us Part I. Cost per Frame For those solely interested in gaming, the 9950X3D doesn't make sense from a cost perspective, given that it costs $700 and delivers similar gaming performance to the much cheaper 9800X3D. Of course, if cost isn't a concern, there's no reason not to choose the 9950X3D over the 9800X3D, as both should provide essentially the same gaming performance. However, for those who prioritize value while still seeking high-end performance, the 9800X3D or even the 7800X3D is a much smarter choice. For a higher-core-count CPU, though, the 9950X3D is the best all-around solution, generally matching or beating the productivity performance of the Core Ultra 9 285K, while smashing it for gaming and offering better overall value. Bonus DDR Results A quick additional data point before our conclusion. G.Skill recently sent over their new Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5-6000 CL28-36-36-96 memory kit, so we decided to test how it performs with the 9950X3D. One of the known benefits of 3D V-Cache processors is that they aren't particularly sensitive to memory performance, so unsurprisingly, we saw minimal improvement with the lower-latency memory kit. This is good news, as 32GB CL30 kits can be found for under $100, making memory an affordable component. What We Learned The Ryzen 9 9950X3D is an easy recommendation with very few caveats. It's fair to say this new Ryzen chip has cemented itself as the best all-around processor for those seeking ultimate performance for both work and play. If productivity is your primary focus, the 9950X3D is likely the best option outside of a super expensive Threadripper processor. In workloads like Cinebench , the 9950X3D and Intel's 285K were neck and neck, with the Ryzen processor consuming just over 10% less power. In general, they should be highly competitive for productivity tasks, but as always, it's best to research specific application performance based on your workflow. Where Intel falls behind significantly is in gaming. Here, the 9950X3D delivered, on average, 35% more performance – a mind-blowing margin unlike anything seen before in AMD vs. Intel comparisons, certainly prior to the release of the 9800X3D . It appears that AMD has effectively addressed the scheduling issues that previously affected 3D V-Cache-enabled dual-CCD processors, at least based on the games we tested. Of course, we will need to analyze this further in future content, but for now, we recommend checking out multiple reviews to get a broader perspective, as different sources will cover a wide range of games. The key takeaway here is that buying a dual-CCD processor with 3D V-Cache is now a far more reliable choice for gamers. There's significantly less need to rely on third-party applications to manually fix scheduling issues, making the overall experience much smoother. The 9950X3D is by far the best dual-CCD processor AMD has released – it just works, and it works exceptionally well."
1,INTEL 9 285K,"Introduction It's finally here! The hotly anticipated Core Ultra 9 285K Arrow Lake-S desktop processor is in our hands, and we can't wait to tell you all about it. The 285K is the flagship processor model from this generation, and logically succeeds the Core i9-14900K. It has all the cores this silicon has to offer—8P+16E, with all the on-chip technologies. It's also fully unlocked and ready for you to take it on an overclocking adventure. The Arrow Lake architecture denotes many firsts for Intel in the desktop market. Notably, this is the company's first desktop processor with a chiplet-based disaggregated design. The mobile segment got it with the Core Ultra Meteor Lake, and Intel has been making chiplet based Xeon Scalable server processors for a few years now. Intel is pricing the Core Ultra 9 285K at $589. Given its core-count and pricing, its apparent rivals from the AMD camp are the Ryzen 9 9950X Zen 5, and the Ryzen 9 7950X3D Zen 4. The Core Ultra 9 285K comes with a maxed out 8P+16E core-configuration. Intel has updated both core types with Arrow Lake. These amount to eight Lion Cove P-cores, with a nominal generational IPC increase, and 16 of the swanky new Skymont E-cores. Skymont was the star of the show with Lunar Lake, as Intel achieved a nearly 50% IPC leap over the Crestmont low-power island E-cores powering the previous generation Meteor Lake. With Arrow Lake, these Skymont cores achieve a 32% IPC jump over the Gracemont E-cores from Raptor Lake. Besides the increased IPC, these E-cores even run at higher clock speeds than Gracemont, which means multithreaded productivity workloads are in for a treat. The 285K is technically a 24-core/24-thread processor. The Lion Cove P-cores ditch SMT. So any gen-on-gen multithreaded performance improvements over the i9-14900K rest squarely on stronger cores and new technology, despite a decrease in total thread count. We've extensively detailed the Arrow Lake microarchitecture in our architecture preview article , which went live a couple of weeks ago. As we mentioned, this is Intel's first desktop processor that's based on chiplets. The guiding philosophy is that rather than building one large monolithic silicon on the latest foundry node (expensive, compounded by lower yields per wafer), Intel identifies specific IP blocks that benefit the most from a switch to the latest foundry node—in this case, the CPU complex—and build a chiplet with it that's smaller (higher yields per wafer thanks to smaller dies). The Compute tile houses the CPU cores, and is built on the TSMC N3B (3 nm) node, which is more advanced than the TSMC N4P (4 nm) node that AMD builds its Zen 5 CCDs on. With this, Intel is taking back foundry technology leadership from AMD after a long span of five years. The iGPU is built on a separate chiplet that uses the still fairly advanced 5 nm TSMC N5 node, while the rest of the processor with the various I/O controllers, and an integrated NPU, are built on TSMC 6 nm—same node as the cIOD on Ryzens. This is Intel's first desktop processor with an NPU, but it isn't the latest NPU 4 from Intel that you find on Core Ultra 200V Lunar Lake mobile processors, but rather the older NPU 3 unit from Core Ultra 100 series Meteor Lake, which can only do 13 TOPS. It hence misses out on Microsoft Copilot+ native acceleration, but don't fret—there's still a lot you can do with 13 TOPS, Windows 11 can put the NPU to good use in its many in-built apps and utilities, and so can Microsoft Teams. Intel has given Arrow Lake-S a fairly powerful iGPU based on the Xe-LPG graphics architecture, and an updated media engine that can accelerate AV1 and HEVC encoding. There are a few changes to the I/O. For starters, DDR4 support is removed, as the memory controllers are re-engineered. The number of PCIe Gen 5 lanes from the CPU are increased to 20, so you can use a Gen 5 NVMe SSD without subtracting PCIe lanes from the x16 PEG slot. There's also integrated Thunderbolt 4. Each of the eight Lion Cove P-cores on the 285K comes with a 3.70 GHz base frequency, and the P-cores boost up to 5.70 GHz. The classic Turbo Boost algorithm boosts P-cores up to 5.50 GHz. Turbo Boost Max 3.0 pushes a couple of cores up a notch to 5.60 GHz, and from there, provided your cooling solution is up to the task, Thermal Velocity Boost enables 5.70 GHz. The 16 E-cores, divided into four clusters, tick at 3.20 GHz with an impressive 4.60 GHz boost frequency. Each P-core comes with a dedicated 3 MB L2 cache, while each E-core cluster shares a 4 MB L2 cache among four E-cores. The P-cores and E-core clusters share a 36 MB L3 cache. Arrow Lake Architecture Intel Arrow Lake microarchitecture seeks to advance all key IP blocks of the processor—the CPU cores, the iGPU and platform I/O interfaces, as well as introduces an NPU; but with Intel's pivot to the latest TSMC 3 nm process (something even Apple's latest SoCs are on), there is a concerted effort to offer a leap in energy efficiency and thermals compared to Raptor Lake, which was built on 10 nm (how's that for a leap?). Of course, it's mighty expensive to build a large monolithic die on 3 nm, and so Intel implemented its second engineering pivot—to disaggregated tile-based processors arranged on an active interposer. Intel made this pivot on mobile with Meteor Lake and server with Sapphire Rapids, but it now arrives at the desktop. The CPU cores are located on a piece of silicon built on 3 nm, called the Compute tile. This talks to the SoC tile with the memory controllers and PCIe root, and can make do with TSMC 6 nm (the same node AMD uses for its I/O die). This SoC tile also includes Intel's NPU 3. The iGPU is located on a dedicated Graphics tile, which is built on a fairly advanced 5 nm process. All the tiles sit on a Foveros base-tile, which acts like an interposer, facilitating high-density microscopic connections among the tiles, and their connections to the fiberglass substrate below using through-silicon vias. Intel says that the die-area of Arrow Lake-S (8P+16E) is 243 mm², and its total transistor count is 17.8 billion. The Compute tile is the most important tile on the processor, it is dedicated to the CPU complex—the collective of 8 Lion Cove performance cores, and 16 Skymont E-cores. All 24 cores share a ringbus interconnect, and a 36 MB L3 cache. Each of the 8 P-cores has a 3 MB L3 cache, the E-cores are arranged in groups of 4 cores, called clusters. Each cluster shares a 4 MB L2 cache among its four cores. Unlike with Alder Lake and Raptor Lake, The P-cores and E-core clusters aren't segregated along two ends of the CPU, rather, they are arranged in alternating rows. There is a row of P-cores, followed by a row of two E-core clusters, and then two rows of P-cores, followed by another row of E-core clusters, and then the final row of P-cores. This approach has two benefits. Firstly, it reduces the concentration of heat during P-core intensive workloads such as gaming. Secondly, it could improve intercore latencies when threads are migrating between P-cores and E-cores, as it cuts down the ringbus stops between the two core types. The SoC tile is the next most important tile. This takes up a mostly-central region of the chip, and is built on the 6 nm process. There are no low-power island E-cores on this tile, unlike with ""Meteor Lake."" The only logic heavy component is the NPU. This tile contains the dual-channel DDR5 memory controller, the DDR5 memory PHY, and the processor's PCI-Express root complex. Not counting the DMI 4.0 x8 chipset bus, the processor puts out 20 PCIe Gen 5 lanes. Of these, 16 are dedicated to the PEG interface (for discrete graphics), and four to a dedicated CPU-attached M.2 NVMe slot. There are actually two CPU-attached M.2 slots. Besides the Gen 5 x4, there is a second Gen 4 x4 connection from the processor. This one comes from the breakout I/O tile, which also contains an integrated 40 Gbps Thunderbolt 4 controller. The SoC tile also contains three of the iGPU's allied components, the Display Engine, the Media Acceleration engine, and the Display I/O. Intel deploys its second generation DDR5 memory controller architecture with Arrow Lake, retiring DDR4 memory support. The older Alder Lake and Raptor Lake feature a memory controller design with two controllers, each handling one channel, and both its 40-bit wide sub-channels; or in DDR4 mode, one controller per memory channel. Since Intel retired DDR4 support, the new architecture sees each of the two memory controllers address a sub-channel of a different channel. So controller 1 would address sub-channels 1 of both channels, while controller 2 would address sub-channels 2 of both channels. This approach probably lets Intel better utilize the sub-channel parallelism on DDR5. Arrow Lake-S supports up to 192 GB of dual-channel memory, with up to 48 GB density per DIMM. It comes with native support for JEDEC DDR5-6400, and Intel says that DDR5-8000 is the ""sweetspot"" overclocking memory speed. The processors also support overclocked memory speeds well beyond this. There are already announcements of DDR5-9600, and throughout 2025 we should see memory speeds well beyond 10000 MT/s, using memory modules that use CKD chips (CUDIMMs or CSODIMMs). ECC is supported by the architecture, though not on the Z890 chipset, nor by the processor models being announced today. The SoC tile integrates an NPU 3 unit, which appears to have been carried over from ""Meteor Lake."" This is based on Intel's 3rd Gen NPU architecture, compared to the 4th Gen NPU on ""Lunar Lake."" NPU 3 has a peak throughput of 13 AI TOPS, which means it falls short of the 40 TOPS requirement for Microsoft Copilot+ local acceleration. The unit contains two NCEs (neural compute engines), with two INT8/FP16 MAC arrays, four SHAVE DSPs, and a 4 MB scratchpad RAM. The third key tile of ""Arrow Lake"" is the Graphics tile, built on the Xe-LPG graphics architecture, which, interestingly, is a generation older than the Xe2 architecture powering the iGPU of ""Lunar Lake."" The Graphics tile is built on the 5 nm TSMC N5P node. This Graphics tile only contains the iGPU's number crunching and graphics rendering machinery, in the form of a single Xe Rendering Slice with four Xe cores, worth 64 execution units (EUs) or 512 unified shaders. The Xe cores of Arrow Lake's graphics tile lack XMX units. Any AI acceleration is in the form of DP4a, and not XMX. The enthusiast mobile ""Arrow Lake-HX"" uses the same Graphics tile. On the other hand, ""Arrow Lake-H"" comes with a larger Graphics tile with eight Xe cores (128 EU, 1,024 unified shaders), and the Xe cores there feature XMX units. Despite having just 4 Xe cores, the Graphics tiles of ""Arrow Lake-S"" and ""Arrow Lake-HX"" feature ray tracing units, one per Xe core, which give them full DirectX 12 Ultimate capability. Intel has also given the iGPU a rather large 4 MB L2 cache, which cushions transfers between it and the SoC tile. The Media Engine of ""Arrow Lake-S"" provides hardware-acceleration for video of up to 8K @ 60 Hz with 10-bit HDR, with supported formats that include VP9, AVC, HEVC, AV1, and SSC. Hardware-accelerated encoding is supported for resolutions of up to 8K @ 120 Hz with 10-bit HDR, with supported formats that include VP9, AVC, HEVC, and AV1. The Display Engine supports up to four display pipes with four low-power pipes, and support for up to five display ports. Standards supported include HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 2.1, and eDP 1.4. Resolutions supported include 8K @ 60 Hz HDR, or four 4K @ 60 Hz HDR, or 1080p @ 360 Hz, or 1440p @ 360 Hz. The Lion Cove P-core The new ""Lion Cove"" P-core replaces the ""Raptor Cove"" cores on the previous generation, as the main compute muscle of Arrow Lake. This is also the P-core on ""Lunar Lake,"" and much like on that chip, the P-cores on Arrow Lake are arranged along a ring-bus with an L3 cache being shared among the P-cores. There is a slight cache difference, though, the dedicated L2 cache has been enlarged to 3 MB from 2.5 MB on the P-cores of Lunar Lake. The eight P-cores, along with the E-core clusters, share a 36 MB L3 cache, compared to the 12 MB on ""Lunar Lake."" Intel has come out with a new set of IPC gain claims for ""Lion Cove."" For ""Arrow Lake,"" Intel claims a 9% IPC gain for ""Lion Cove,"" compared to the ""Raptor Cove"" core of ""Raptor Lake-S."" In the ""Lunar Lake"" architecture reveal, the company claimed a 14% IPC gain, but that claim was made against the ""Redwood Cove"" P-core of a 15 W model of ""Meteor Lake,"" since ""Lunar Lake"" is a one of a kind fully-integrated chip that has no predecessors except chips of a comparable power class from ""Meteor Lake."" Much like on ""Lunar Lake,"" the ""Lion Cove"" P-core of ""Arrow Lake"" lacks Hyper-Threading, Intel has physically removed the on-core components needed for SMT. This was done to reduce the size of the core, and with the idea that the IPC and energy-efficiency gains would overcome the need for SMT, together with physical threads on E-Cores. Having gained both die-area and power headroom from deprecating SMT, Intel moved on to overhauling the microarchitecture itself. There are improvements to all key components, including a redesigned front-end, with an 8 times larger branch prediction block. The fetch unit and decode bandwidth has been increased. The micro-op cache has increased in capacity, and Intel has introduced the concept of ""nano-ops,"" which are groups of similar broken down micro-operation tasks that can be executed in tandem. The Integer and Vector domains, which form the out-of-order execution engine, has now split, with individual access to the micro-op queue, and independent schedulers. The out-of-order engine sees the allocation rename/move elimination queue to now be 8-wide compared to 6-wide on Redwood Cove. The retirement queue is broadened 50% to 12-wide from 8-wide. The instruction window depth has increased from 512 to 576. Execution ports have gone up from 12 to 18. The Integer ALUs have increased in number from 5 to 6, with 3 jump units instead of 2, 3 shift units instead of 2, and three MUL units instead of 1. The vector execution engine sees 4 SIMD ALUs instead of 3, two FMA units @ 4 cycle, and 2 divider units. The load-store subsystem sees 128 DTLB size, up from 96, and 3 STE address generators instead of 2. Intel has also redone the core-level cache subsystem, with the introduction of an intermediate data cache between the 48 KB L1 and L2. The L1D cache is now referred to as the L0 D-cache, which retires to a 192 KB L1 D-cache. This talks to the L2 cache. On Arrow Lake, each Lion Cove core gets 3 MB (3,072 KB) of dedicated L2 cache. Intel has deployed a new AI-based power management system for the P-cores, which is controlled by the SMU of the cores themselves. The CPU clock of the P-cores now have a fine 16.67 MHz granularity. The Skymont E-core The new ""Skymont"" E-core was the single biggest talking point about ""Lunar Lake."" Intel achieved a 38% IPC uplift over the ""Crestmont"" E-cores of ""Meteor Lake"" in integer workloads, and a mammoth 68% IPC uplift over ""Crestmont"" in floating point workloads. There is a catch here. The E-cores on ""Lunar Lake"" are not part of a ring-bus with the P-cores (i.e. sharing their L3 cache), but separated out into a low-power island E-core cluster, and so Intel was making these IPC comparisons with the ""Crestmont"" low-power island E-cores of ""Meteor Lake,"" located in the SoC tile. What's changed with ""Arrow Lake"" is that now all the ""Skymont"" E-core clusters are part of the Compute ring-bus, and share the L3 cache with the P-cores. The comparison is hence being made with the ""Gracemont"" E-cores of ""Raptor Lake-S."" All this said, the company claims a 32% IPC uplift over ""Gracemont,"" which is still a mighty impressive generational gain. This 32% IPC uplift of the ""Skymont"" E-cores on ""Arrow Lake"" play a crucial role in ensuring that the processor ends up posting generational gains in multithreaded productivity performance, despite the P-cores no longer featuring Hyper-Threading. The 16 E-cores on ""Arrow Lake"" are arranged in clusters of 4 cores each, and each cluster shares a 4 MB L2 cache among its cores. Intel claims to have doubled the bandwidth of this shared L2 cache compared to the ""Gracemont"" E-core clusters of ""Raptor Lake-S."" Skymont's journey towards becoming something special begins with the fetch and branch prediction unit, which now looks 128 bytes ahead for possible branches, speeding up the instruction fetch. Up to 96 instruction bytes are fetched in parallel. The front-end sees a new 9-wide decode (compared to 6-wide on Crestmont), support for nano-code (similar segments of microcode clumped together for greater parallelism), and a broader micro-op queue of 96 entries instead of 64 on the previous generation. The out-of-order engine sees the meat of the updates. The allocation queue is 8-wide (up from 6-wide), and the retire queue is 16-wide (up from 8-wide). There is intelligence behind dependency breaking. The out-of-order window is broadened to 416 entries, up from 256, as are the physical register files, reservation stations, and load-store unit buffering. There are 26 dispatch ports to the execution engine, leading to 8 integer ALUs, with 3 jump ports, and 3 loads per cycle (50% increase). The vector engine features four 128-bit FPUs, doubling GigaFLOPS. The FMUL, FADD, and FMA latencies are reduced. FP rounding now sees native hardware acceleration. Additional execution units should also benefit AI performance. The load/store unit sees 33% to 50% increases in loads, and store address generation performance. The L2 TLB has increased in size to 4,192 entries, up from 3,096. Thread Director Updates With ""Arrow Lake,"" Intel is introducing the third generation of Thread Director, its hardware-based scheduler that ensures the right kind of software workload is handled by the right kind of CPU core. This new version comes with a more accurate hardware-based E-core performance feedback mechanism, which tells it the kind of E-core resources available. Intel also introduced new P-core performance telemetry for more accurate direction of threads to the P-cores. Intel also gave Thread Director its most accurate prediction model. With ""Skymont"" cores having such significantly higher IPC, Thread Director on ""Arrow Lake-S"" prioritizes all non-gaming productivity workloads to the E-cores, and upgrades threads to the P-cores only as needed. Thread Director plays a significant role in improving the processor's overall power efficiency. Intel LGA1851 Platform The new LGA1851 socket retains cooler compatibility with LGA1700. The processor packages have identical dimensions and Z-Height to help with this compatibility, too, but you cannot use an LGA1700 processor on an LGA1851 socket. Among other things, the additional pins are for the four extra PCIe Gen 5 lanes the processor puts out, for a CPU-attached Gen 5 NVMe SSD that doesn't eat into the PEG x16. There are two kinds of ILM (independent loading modules) for the socket, some of the premium motherboard models include the new reduced load ILMs (RL-ILMs), which works to reduce mounting pressure on the package, letting you mount heavier coolers, such as LN2 evaporators. RL-ILMs are clearly marked on the metal brace. Another telltale is the presence of a white insulator pad under the ILM, near the mounting screws. With the Core Ultra 2-series ""Arrow Lake-S,"" Intel is debuting a new socket, LGA1851. You will hence require a new motherboard to go with your shiny new processor, and since all processor models Intel is launching this year are unlocked K or KF SKUs, the only motherboard chipset model available will be the top-spec Intel Z890. Intel will flesh out its processor model stack in 2025, and with it, launch more affordable motherboard chipsets. The ""Arrow Lake-S"" SoC puts out a dual-channel DDR5 memory interface, which we described in the previous pages. It also features a massive 48 platform PCIe lanes (CPU + chipset). Intel has increased the number of PCIe Gen 5 lanes put out by the CPU to 20—that's 16 lanes meant for the PEG (x16 slot for graphics cards), and one CPU-attached M.2 NVMe slot that runs at Gen 5 speeds without eating into the 16 PEG lanes. The CPU puts out a second set of Gen 4 x4, which can be wired out as an M.2 slot, or be used to drive high-bandwidth onboard devices, such as a discrete Thunderbolt 5 controller. The processor itself fully integrates a Thunderbolt 4 controller, which puts out a couple of 40 Gbps ports. The processor connects to the Z890 chipset over a DMI 4.0 x8 chipset bus (bandwidth comparable to PCI-Express 4.0 x8). It puts out 24 PCI-Express Gen 4 downstream lanes. This is a massive increase from the Z790 chipset, which put out 16 Gen 4 and 8 Gen 3 lanes. The integrated USB complex consists of 32 USB 3.2 5 Gbps serial-deserializers, which can be configured by motherboard designers into five 20 Gbps ports, ten 10 Gbps ports, and ten 5 Gbps ports. There's also a 14-port USB 2.0 hub. Intel has retired the HDA ""Azalia"" audio interface with Z890, which means onboard audio CODECs will have to use the newer MIPI SoundWire and USB 3.2 interfaces (which CODECs like the Realtek ALC4080 and ALC4082 already do). The chipset integrates a 1 GbE MAC, and Wi-Fi 6. With the PCIe and USB 3.2 connectivity on offer, motherboard vendors can go bonkers with network connectivity, by giving their platforms Wi-Fi 7 and 2.5 GbE, or even 5 GbE and 10 GbE. Vendors can opt for Intel's Killer networking package, which combines existing Intel networking PHY with the advanced Killer prioritization engine, and DoubleShot Pro, which work together to reduce network latency when gaming. Intel has revamped the security architecture for its client processors with ""Arrow Lake,"" giving them three separate hardware security engines, including a purpose-built Converged Security and Manageability Engine (basically the Intel ME but with added security roles), the Silicon Security Engine, which is microarchitecture-level hardening for the new Lion Cove and Skymont CPU cores, a new dedicated security controller for the iGPU, and compliance with Microsoft Secured Core. Overclocking The governing idea behind Arrow Lake is to offer generational performance gains along expected lines, but with a leap in energy efficiency from the new tile-based disaggregation, and switch to the new 3 nm foundry node for key logic components of the chip. Conversely, this means that the high efficiency opens up some overclocking headroom. Arrow Lake introduces a dual base-clock domain architecture. There are now two independent BCLK domains, one for the Compute tile, and the other for the SoC tile. This is crucial in ensuring that BCLK-based overclocking doesn't destabilize other clock domains such as PCIe clock, which will stick to the BCLK domain of the SoC tile. Next up, Intel added a granularity of 16.67 MHz for the clock speeds of the P-cores and E-cores, letting you fine-tune your overclock that much better. The tile-to-tile fabric has a clock domain of its own, which can either be overclocked with a static frequency setting, or in a ratio with CPU clock speeds. DLVR (digital linear voltage regulator) bypass lets certain premium motherboards override the internal voltage management of the processor with smart discrete voltage regulation controllers for superior OC. Arrow Lake supports V/f curve control on a per P-core and per E-core cluster basis. The processor's SMU can detect low-temperature cooling solutions in an overclocked scenario, and bypass voltage limits as the chip gets cooler. Lastly, ""Arrow Lake"" offers native support for CUDIMMs and CSODIMMs. These are DDR5 memory modules with CKD (client clock drivers), which clean up signal integrity, improving the memory signal eyes and allowing for higher frequencies. Some of the newer memory kits with over 8000 MT/s XMP tend to be CUDIMMs. The revamped power management, switch to the newer TSMC 3 nm node (where it matters), and other optimizations mean that besides lower power, the average package temperature of the 285K is around 13°C lower than that of the i9-14900K. In lightly threaded use-cases, Intel claims an up to 58% lower package power than the i9-14900K. Unboxing and Photography The Intel Core Ultra 9 285K comes in a special retail packaging. The processor is enclosed in a jewel-case that peeks out of the side. The front face of the box has some reflective bits that set it apart from retail boxes of other processor models in the series. This looks like an LGA1700 CPU, but trust us, it won't fit on your older motherboard. The dimensions are identical to ensure cooler compatibility, but the key notch is different. Intel created space for those 151 extra pins by reducing the ""island"" in the middle of the land-grid. Installing an LGA1851 processor is identical to that of an LGA1700 processor. Test Setup All applications, games, and processors are tested with the drivers and hardware listed below—no performance results were recycled between test systems. All games and applications are tested using the same version. All games are set to their highest quality setting unless indicated otherwise. Now that DDR5 has gained some maturity, we will use faster DDR5 speeds with tighter timings in upcoming reviews (once we retest the 40+ CPUs in our test group) The ASUS Z890 Hero motherboard feeds four of the CPU VRM phases from the 24-pin ATX connector , instead of the 8-pins, which makes it impossible to measure CPU-only power with dedicated test equipment (we're not trusting any CPU software power sensors). You either lose some power because only the two 8-pin CPU connectors are measured, or you end up including power for the GPU, chips, and storage when measuring the two 8-pin connectors along with the 24-pin ATX. For this reason, we used an MSI Z890 Carbon for the power consumption tests in this review.

AIDA64 comes with a great benchmark that provides a nice overview of all these performance characteristics. Y-Cruncher Y-Cruncher is a highly optimized piece of software that can calculate Pi and other constants to a huge number of digits. It is fully multithreaded, uses a modern code design and is optimized for all major processor architectures. This ability has made it a popular application, used by the enthusiast community to determine and compare how powerful their overclocked systems are. Chess Simulation Creating a worthwhile opponent for the game of chess has been one of the most fascinating tasks for computer programmers for decades. In this test we're using the highly popular Stockfish chess engine to calculate optimal moves in a chess scenario. Each CPU is running at the fastest instruction set supported, including AVX512-VNNI, AVX256-VNNI, AVX512, BMI2 and AVX2. Web Browsing — JetStream 2 The JetStream 2 browser benchmark combines multiple JavaScript and WebAssembly benchmarks with several advanced workloads to determine how quickly a browser can complete specific tasks. It not only rewards high overall performance, but also fast startup and consistent operation. Web Browsing — Speedometer 2 Speedometer 2 tests a ""to-do list"" web application that's implemented using a huge number of popular frameworks. Among the benchmarks are versions built with React, Ember.js, AngularJS, vue.js, jQuery and others—frameworks that are used by the most popular sites in the world. AI Inference — GPT2 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have enabled us to create applications that are almost magical in their abilities. GPT-2 is a powerful language model developed by OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, that excels at generating human-quality text. It's a key AI workload because it tests the efficiency and capability of AI systems in handling complex language tasks, which is crucial for many real-world applications. We are measuring the time it takes to generate 100 stories starting with the ""Once upon a time, there was a"" prompt. AI Inference — Stable Diffusion Stable Diffusion stands out as the second rock star AI workload. This cutting-edge image generation model creates high-quality, detailed visuals from textual descriptions. Its ability to produce realistic images has wide-ranging implications for industries such as art, design, advertising, and media, enabling innovative content creation and enhancing visual storytelling. We are timing how long it takes to generate a single image for the prompt ""a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on Mars."" AI / Inference — Image Upscaling Topaz Photo AI is a premier tool for AI-driven image processing. It enhances image resolution and quality by intelligently increasing detail and reducing noise. This advanced capability improves the clarity and sharpness of assets, making it a valuable tool for anyone needing high-resolution images. Our test reports how long it takes to upscale a 1.5 megapixel image to 22 megapixels. AI Training — Natural Language Processing Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves training AI models in understanding and generating human language. By applying algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret text data, NLP enables tasks like translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation. We are measuring how long it takes to train a BERT language model with a collection of movie critic reviews. AI Training — Image Classification Image classification is a crucial AI workload because recognizing objects within images is essential for many practical applications, including autonomous driving, facial recognition, medical imaging, and inventory management. This process involves using algorithms to analyze and extract features from images. During training, these methods learn patterns and attributes from labeled datasets. Our test involves training a model with several thousand images to classify photos of clothing into categories such as ""T-Shirt,"" ""Bag,"" and ""Pullover."" Sony PS3 Emulator RPCS3 is a popular PlayStation 3 emulator for PCs, which let you play many Sony PS3 titles on your favorite platform. The emulator has serious hardware requirements, and some of its emulation threads constantly need to communicate with each other, which makes it a tough workload for many CPU architectures. RPCS3 also benefits from faster cache and memory speeds, when available. AVX-512 is enabled where supported, including Zen 4 and Zen 5. Nintendo Switch Emulator Ryujinx is a highly compatible, feature-rich emulator for the Nintendo Switch console. It relies heavily on your CPU, and also comes with some tricks how to use the memory management unit (MMU) of your processor to handle the emulated environment. While it is multithreaded, higher single-core performance is more important than being able to scale to many cores. Rendering — Cinebench Cinebench is one of the most popular modern CPU benchmarks because it is built around the renderer of Maxon's Cinema 4D software. Both AMD and Intel have been showing this performance test at various public events, making it almost an industry standard. Using Cinebench 2024, we test both single-threaded and multithreaded performance. Rendering — Blender Blender is one of the few professional-grade rendering programs out there that is both free and open source. That fact alone helped build a strong community around the software, making it a highly popular benchmark program due to its ease of use as well. For our testing, we're using the Blender ""BMW 27"" benchmark scene with Blender 4.0.2. Rendering — Corona Corona Renderer is a modern photorealistic renderer that's available for Autodesk 3ds Max and Cinema 4D. It delivers physically plausible and predictable output due to its realistic lighting algorithm, global illumination, and beautiful materials. Corona does not support GPU rendering, so CPU performance is very important for all its users. We do not use the horribly outdated Corona Benchmark tool, which doesn't support new architectures, instead using the much newer version 11. Rendering — KeyShot The standalone KeyShot rendering software features fast and efficient workflows that help you get realistic high-quality product shots in the shortest possible time frame. Real-time ray tracing, multicore photon mapping, adaptive material sampling, and a dynamic lighting core provide high-quality images that update instantly even when interactively working on the scene. KeyShot 2023.3 is optimized for usage on both CPUs and GPUs. We use the CPU renderer because the GPU renderer still has some limitations in terms of rendering capability. Rendering — V-Ray V-Ray is a world-leading 3D rendering software that uses global illumination, path tracing, photon mapping, and irradiance maps to achieve super-realistic render output. It has been used for CG in countless motion pictures and television series. V-Ray supports all major 3D applications, which makes it a great fit for any rendering pipeline. In this test, we're using the V-Ray 6 benchmark tool in CPU-only mode to get the number of ""vsamples"" that can be processed on a given hardware. Higher is better. Game Development — Unreal Engine 5 Unreal Engine 5 is the leading multi-platform game engine in the industry. Not only advanced, it also has lots of features to help you get results quicker than with competing products—time is money. The latest version 5 adds several new features that make the engine not only suitable for gaming, but also for architecture, automotive and movie production. Before a game is shipped, there is a lengthy process called ""build, cook and package,"" which optimizes the various assets, compiling and compressing them into versions that will work best on the target platform, before packaging them into optimized bundles ready for distribution. We use a relatively simple scene—usually this process takes several hours. Software Development - Git Source Code Management In software development, a version control system (VCS) is essential for tracking changes and managing files, enabling developers to record updates, revert to previous versions, compare changes, and work together efficiently. Git, a distributed version control system, takes this further by allowing each contributor to have a complete copy of the project history, facilitating offline work and robust collaboration. While Git usually operates quickly, certain tasks, such as repository optimization and data management, can be computationally intensive. Our test measures the time it takes to complete a set of such operations. Software Development — Visual Studio C++ Microsoft Visual C++ is probably the most popular programming language for creating professional Windows applications. It's part of Microsoft's Visual Studio development suite, which has a long history and is widely accepted as the gold standard when it comes to IDEs. Compiling software is a relatively lengthy process that turns program code into the final executable, and programmers hate waiting for it to complete. We run a medium-sized application through the Visual Studio 2022 C++ compiler and linker, and use the resource compiler, too. The build is executed in ""release"" mode with all optimizations turned on and multiprocessor compilation enabled. Media Encoding — AV1 Nowadays, all video that is consumed, whether on TV, physical media, or streamed over the internet, is compressed using various codecs. AV1 is a next-generation video codec that is open and royalty-free, unlike other recent new video compression algorithms. Major industry players like YouTube, Netflix, and Facebook stand behind AV1 and are gradually rolling out support for the new format. Compared to older algorithms, such as H.264, the compression rate is much better, or you can achieve higher image quality for a given bitrate. We use the SVT-AV1 encoder with a 4K video source to compress to AV1. Media Encoding — H.265 / HEVC Our second video-encoding test uses the H.265 codec, which is also known as HEVC. Compared to H.264 it provides superior compression efficiency, reducing file sizes and bandwidth usage while maintaining high video quality. We compress a 4K video using the latest version of the X265 encoder with 8-bit color depth, preset ""slow,"" and a quality setting of crf 20. Media Encoding — H.264 / AVC H.264, also called AVC, is a slightly older compression format, though probably the most widely used these days because it is well-supported, even on older hardware. We compress the same video as in the H.265 test using the X264 encoding software, with the preset ""slower"" and crf 20. Media Encoding — MP3 MP3 revolutionized the music industry like no other technology. Introduced in the 90s, it enabled a massive reduction in audio-file sizes, without noticeable impact on sound quality. This made music downloads, and ultimately streaming, a feasible method for content delivery over the Internet. Our benchmark converts a 2.5 hour-long 44.1 kHz Stereo recording to a variable bitrate MP3 file. MP3 encoding is a single-threaded process. Microsoft Office Microsoft's Office suite needs no introduction as it's probably the most widely used PC software on the planet, installed on every office computer no matter the industry. Our tests cover a wide range of editing and creation tasks in Word, PowerPoint, Excel and Outlook. Image Editing — Adobe Photoshop Adobe Photoshop has become the industry standard for photo and image processing. We run Photoshop 2024 through a battery of typical editing tasks, like image resize, various blurs, sharpening, color and light adjustments, and image export. We also apply more complex actions like content-aware fill, lens correction, smart sharpen, select subject, and tilt shift. Video Editing — Adobe Premiere Pro Adobe Premiere Pro is the workhorse of the video production industry for creating high-quality content for film, TV, and the web. It can handle pretty much every recorded file format and supports workflows for editing Full HD, 4K, 8K, and virtual reality content. Unfortunately, most of Premiere Pro is single-threaded, and media encoding is highly GPU accelerated, so benchmarking ""export"" on the CPU makes little sense. For our testing, we're using the software's ""object tracking"" functionality, which automatically scans through a video to follow a specific person or object—this task does indeed use more than a single core, but doesn't fully scale. A lot of memory is consumed and accessed in the process, over 10 GB for our test scene. Video Production — Adobe After Effects While Premiere Pro is optimized for cutting, arranging and editing videos, Adobe After Effects is the industry standard for creating motion graphics, text rendering, color correction and other visual effects like outlines, explosions etc. When applied, each of these takes up a little bit of CPU time, so when there's many of them, processing duration will increase quite a bit. We're measuring the time it takes to export a short intro trailer, including music and sound. Create 3D Model from Photos Creating 3D models is a tedious and complex task that takes time and requires experienced artists. It's thus the holy grail of 3D modeling to reconstruct a 3D model from just a series of photos. That's exactly what Photogrammetry does. This method is also used to reconstruct terrain geometry from photos taken by aerial drones. Physics Simulation COMSOL is the gold standard for the accurate simulation of physics effects and one of the strongest competitors to Ansys. Where the software shines is in solving multiphysics problems that depend on several phenomena—you can simulate everything, including black holes. The modular aspect of COMSOL helps professionals customize the software to their desires, which can be run with a single module or a whole multitude of collaborating modules for more demanding tasks, as well as with two-way communication with external programs, such as CAD software. Chemistry Simulation NAMD is developed by the University of Illinois and helps researchers simulate the dynamic interactions between molecules and atoms. It is an established means of molecular dynamics simulation that scales from individual clusters of molecules to full-on chemical interaction in different phases. Parallel simulation modes help differentiate NAMD from its peers, allowing efficient problem-solving of larger systems using the Charm++ parallel programming model as the base. Medical Science — Genome Analysis COVID-19 has shown the world that deadly pandemics can bring society to a standstill. Computational genomics is essential for rapid development of vaccine candidates in a race against time. In this test we're running an analysis on a set of genomes to determine which individuals in the dataset share common traits in their DNA. This is not only a compute-intensive workload, but it also uses quite a lot of memory (over 10 GB), which makes it dependent on the performance of the memory subsystem. Antivirus Scan Securing your system against viruses and malware is essential for reliable operation. Antivirus software detects unwanted programs by comparing files to a large database with thousands of signatures and rules. In this test we're measuring how long it takes to scan all files of a 30 GB game. Altium PCB Designer Altium Designer has been used to make at least one of the circuit boards inside your favorite piece of electronics. It's an industry-leading solution to build complex PCBs by automating circuit paths and ensuring that signal integrity and design rules are followed in the design. Our test measures how long it takes for Altium PCB Designer to load a project, run various operations on it, including autorouting, design rule check and finally releasing the whole design to manufacturing. Text Recognition OCR — Google Tesseract Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is the task of turning text in scanned images or photos into actual characters for archival, further processing, or editing. While most OCR software is single-threaded, Google's Tesseract engine can operate on multiple pages of a scanned document at once, spreading the load over several processor cores. The software, which is considered one of the most accurate open-source OCR packages available, automatically runs a spellcheck on the initial recognition results, which adds to the complexity of the workload. Virtualization — Oracle VirtualBox A virtual machine is a simulated computer inside your computer that's completely independent of the host PC. This not only improves security, but also enables software written for different operating systems to execute on one physical machine. Virtualization is the foundation for ""the cloud"" and helps reduce hardware ownership cost by dynamically spreading out virtual machines over multiple computers to make the best use of available hardware resources. We're testing VM performance using Oracle's VM VirtualBox software, with hardware virtualization support enabled for both Intel and AMD processors. Curiously, many motherboards ship with the virtualization setting disabled by default, so we made absolutely certain we had enabled it. Database — MySQL More data is stored and processed today than ever before in human history. Database systems that manage storage and retrieval throughout large data sets are the backbone for this revolution. Whenever you interact with a website or other digital service, one database is almost always guaranteed to be involved in returning the results you are looking for. We benchmark the most popular database system, MySQL, in the TPC-C test, which simulates many warehouses and their constantly changing inventory. The reported number is ""transactions per second,"" so higher is better. Database — NoSQL While traditional relational databases are the industry standard for a lot of workloads, NoSQL databases use a different, non-tabular approach, which offers tremendous speedups for certain workloads. That's why they are used in many big data and real-time web applications today. We benchmark how long it takes MongoDB to complete 10 million requests. Java The Java programming language is designed to be platform independent, highly scalable, and fault-tolerant, which is why it's very popular for enterprise services that work with lots of data and many concurrent users. Our test suite consists of a large mix of individual Java benchmarks, some of them single-threaded, some that scale somewhat, and some that fully scale to as many cores as are available. Web Hosting People don't like excessive load times in their browser, which makes handling all the incoming requests of a busy website in a timely manner a non-trivial task that can potentially overload some server systems. In our web server benchmark we're recording how long it takes an ASP.NET Core 6.0 based content management system to process a million requests to its ""about us"" page. Our benchmark uses an in-memory mock database to not be bottlenecked by the backing database engine. Compression — WinRAR Data is compressed almost all the time when it moves over the wire to reduce download time and transfer sizes. WinRAR uses a more advanced compression algorithm than classic ZIP, which is why we chose it for this test. It's also able to scale across multiple processor cores. Compression — 7-Zip Another popular compression software is 7-Zip, which includes a benchmark that measures the integer instruction rate (MIPS) using the ZIP algorithm. It makes good use of multiple threads, when available. Encryption — AES Encryption is the foundation for secure communication on the internet. The AES encryption standard is one of the most popular encryption algorithm these days because of its simplicity and resistance to attacks. Unlike other encryption methods, AES is symmetric, which means the same key is used for encrypting and decrypting data. Being able to quickly encrypt and decrypt information is important, which is the reason why modern processors have an instruction set extension called ""AES-NI"" that accelerates these operations. Encryption — SHA3 ""SHA"" is technically not encryption, but hashing. A cryptographic hash function is a mathematical algorithm that creates a fingerprint value for existing data. This is a one-way function, which is practically impossible to invert. Another requirement for a good hashing algorithm is that you can't create a collision: craft a message that yields a specific hash value. The SHA3 algorithm achieves all that and is also often used to authenticate transmitted data which possibly was encrypted with AES first. Game Tests: 720p On popular demand from comments over the past several CPU reviews, we are including game tests at 720p (1280x720 pixels) resolution. All games from our CPU test suite are put through 720p using a RTX 4090 graphics card and Ultra settings. This low resolution serves to highlight theoretical CPU performance, because games are extremely CPU-limited at this resolution. Of course, nobody buys a PC with an RTX 4090 to game at 720p, but the results are of academic value because a CPU that can't do 144 frames per second at 720p will never reach that mark at higher resolutions. So, these numbers could interest high-refresh-rate gaming PC builders with fast monitors. Our 720p tests hence serve as synthetic tests in that they are not real world (720p isn't a real-world PC-gaming resolution anymore) even though the game tests themselves are not synthetic (they're real games, not 3D benchmarks). Individual Benchmark Scores Gaming with Ray Tracing Game Tests 1080p Individual Benchmark Scores Gaming with Ray Tracing Game Tests 1440p Individual Benchmark Scores Gaming with Ray Tracing Game Tests 4K Individual Benchmark Scores Gaming with Ray Tracing Minimum FPS While average FPS is the most useful metric to tell you the typical experience during gameplay, minimum FPS will tell you what's happening in worst-cases, like during intense battles or other demanding situations. All results on this page report the 1% Low FPS, or 99th percentile. Per definition these results are based on a smaller set of data for each benchmark run, which makes the numbers more unpredictable, so the uncertainties are higher than in our normal average FPS data. You may look at all the individual test runs by clicking the button at the end of the page. Individual Benchmark Scores Show Per-Game Results Integrated Graphics Performance Intel has given the Core Ultra ""Arrow Lake-S"" processors a significant upgrade with integrated graphics. The iGPU is split between the Graphics tile and the SoC tile. The Graphics tile is built on a 5 nm EUV node, and contains the graphics rendering pipeline and the number crunching machinery located in the Xe cores, while the SoC tile contains the Media engine, the Display engine, and the Display I/O. The iGPU of ""Arrow Lake-S"" is based on the Xe-LPG graphics architecture; Intel debuted this with ""Meteor Lake."" It is a step-up from the Xe-LP based iGPU found on ""Raptor Lake,"" in that it features full DirectX 12 Ultimate capability, including real-time ray tracing. The Xe cores of Xe-LPG come with ray tracing units, and the hardware needed to pull off mesh shaders and sampler feedback—the other two key technologies making up DirectX 12 Ultimate; but what sets the Xe-LPG apart from Xe-HPG architecture powering Arc A-series discrete gaming GPUs, is the lack of XMX matrix-math accelerators. The GPU still supports AI acceleration under the DP4a format, and so XeSS will work with the same fallbacks it uses for GPUs of other brands. The Graphics tile of ""Arrow Lake-S"" comes with four Xe cores, which work out to 64 execution units (EU) or 512 unified shaders. The upcoming ""Arrow Lake-H"" processor for mainstream notebooks comes with a larger Graphics tile that uses Xe-HPG architecture, which means the presence of XMX units. It also comes with 8 Xe cores, which should mean 1,024 unified shaders. All the games on this page are running at their lowest possible detail setting (benchmarks on the ""dGPU RTX 4090"" pages use maximum settings, so they are not directly comparable). 720p 1080p Full HD Individual Benchmark Scores Application Power Consumption All power measurements on this page are based on a physical measurement of the voltage, current and power flowing through the 8-pin EPS CPU power connector(s), which makes them ""CPU only,"" not ""full system."" We're not using the software sensors inside the processor, as these can be quite inaccurate and will vary between manufacturers. All measurements are collected and processed at a rate of 30 data points per second, on a separate machine, so the power measurement does not affect the tested system in any way. Our new data processing pipeline allows us to link recorded data precisely with benchmark runs, so we can easily create the charts below. The ASUS Z890 Hero motherboard feeds four of the CPU VRM phases from the 24-pin ATX connector , instead of the 8-pins, which makes it impossible to measure CPU-only power with dedicated test equipment (we're not trusting any CPU software power sensors). You either lose some power because only the two 8-pin CPU connectors are measured, or you end up including power for the GPU, chips, and storage when measuring the two 8-pin connectors along with the 24-pin ATX. For this reason, we used an MSI Z890 Carbon motherboard exclusively for the power consumption tests in this review. Gaming Power Consumption Idle Power Usage Idle power usage is important for assessing energy efficiency, too. It reveals the power consumed when the system isn't actively in use—which is often the case for many computers. Unlike our other measurements, which report ""CPU power only,"" these results are measured at the wall socket (230 V AC). The system is configured as detailed in the Test Setup section, i.e. with one SSD and one discrete graphics card installed. Energy Efficiency Just looking at power draw in watts won't paint the whole picture for any given processor. It's not only important how much power is consumed, but also how quickly a task is completed—taking both into account results in ""efficiency."" Since a faster processor will complete a given workload quicker, the total amount of energy used might end up less than on a low-powered processor, which might draw less power, but will also take longer to finish the test. In this section, we divide the performance achieved by the power usage, to get a Cinebench points per watt single-threaded and multithreaded result. For gaming (with GeForce RTX 4090) we divide the average FPS of all our games by the power consumed, for a frames-per-watt rating. All these tests are based on our CPU-only power measurements, not whole system. Power vs Core i9-14900K Power vs Ryzen 9 9950X Power vs Ryzen 9 9900X Power vs Ryzen 9 7950X3D Power vs Ryzen 7 7800X3D NPU Performance As mentioned before, Intel Core Ultra 200 Arrow Lake is the first Intel desktop processor architecture that includes an NPU to enhance AI processing capabilities, providing a significant boost in handling machine learning tasks efficiently. It contributes to energy efficiency by offloading specific AI workloads from the CPU and GPU. The main goal is not to be faster, but to be more energy-efficient. The NPU 3 in Arrow Lake is rated for 13 TOPS, which is not a lot, but should be sufficient for a lot of tasks that run locally. Right now, most AI experiences are cloud-based, which adds latency and has privacy issues. Hardware vendors hope that in the future, more AI applications run locally, which is why these dedicated AI accelerator units are being introduced in processors. For performance benchmarks, we ran some quick Geekbench AI tests, comparing iGPU vs CPU vs NPU performance across several CPUs. The results confirm that the NPU can work as useful coprocessor that consumes only a small amount of power and die area. What's CUDIMM Memory? Note the marked IC in the middle of the memory module. With Arrow Lake, Intel is introducing support for CUDIMM DDR5 memory, which stands for ""Clocked Unbuffered Dual Inline Memory Module."" These DIMMs represent an advancement over standard DDR5 memory by incorporating a CKD (Clock Driver) chip directly on the memory modules. Instead of having to drive each memory chip individually, over a relatively long distance, the CPU can now send a signal to just the Clock Driver, which then drives the memory chips directly over a short distance, which helps with signal integrity, especially at high clock frequencies. G.SKILL sent us their upcoming F5-8800C4255H24GX2-TZ5CK, a 2x 24 GB DDR5-8800 CUDIMM memory kit—very impressive. We will be using this in an upcoming Arrow Lake Memory Scaling article. For now, see below for some quick results. Performance Scaling To get a feel for performance improvements with faster memory, we ran some benchmarks using G.SKILL's CUDIMM DDR5-8800 memory kit with the Ultra 9 285K. Please note that this is a different test setup than our regular main test suite, so the results are not directly comparable, despite the same test names. Temperatures We're using a Noctua NH-D15 for temperature measurements. Application temperatures are measured using Blender, a highly demanding rendering load, which will load all cores completely, but that's still realistic and is not a synthetic stress test such as Prime95. For gaming, we picked Cyberpunk 2077, its modern engine is multi-thread aware and will try to spread as many tasks as possible over many CPU cores, when available. Even when a game uses multiple threads it doesn't load each CPU core as heavily as rendering, for example, so there's some scope for power savings here. Note that unless indicated otherwise, all processors are tested at stock conditions with their power limit active, which is why some Intel temperatures are surprisingly low. As designed by Intel, these CPUs can exceed their TDP for a few seconds (PL2), but in the long term, the power limit (PL1) is respected, which brings temperatures down considerably. Both tests report the steady-state temperature after an extended runtime of at least 10 minutes. Temperatures are based on delta T, normalized to 25°C, that's why the temperature of some CPUs is higher than their throttle point, because the room temperature was below 25°C. For recent Intel CPUs we've increased the temperature limit in BIOS from 100/105°C to 115°C, to get a better feel for temperatures without thermal throttling getting in the way. AMD Zen 4 and Zen 5 CPUs have their thermal target set to 95°C, which means the CPU will boost as much as it can, until it reaches that point, to maximize performance. Unlike on Intel, on AMD's AM5 platform it's not possible to increase the 95°C limit. Temperature testing on this page uses air-cooling, for consistency and to show comparable results. All performance testing on the other pages is done using an Arctic Cooling Liquid Freezer III liquid cooling solution that keeps the temperatures well below all limits, to ensure there is no thermal throttling. Clock Frequencies The following chart shows how well the processor sustains its clock frequency and which boost clock speeds are achieved at various thread counts. This test uses a custom-coded application that mimics real-life performance—it is not a stress test like Prime95. Modern processors change their clocking behavior depending on the type of load, which is why we provide three plots with classic floating point math, SSE SIMD code, and modern AVX vector instructions. Each of the three test runs calculates the same result using the same algorithm, just with a different CPU instruction set. The rated 5.7 GHz top speed is easy to reach, but only for a short time, with a light load, on the two best P-Cores. As you can see, even with two threads active, or a single heavy thread, the average is already down a little bit. The E-Core side of this chart (threads 9 to 24) can be somewhat misleading. It looks like the cores run at increasingly slower frequencies as the load goes up, but that's not the case. The frequency plotted is the average of all the P-Cores active, plus more and more E-Cores, which all run at a lower frequency than the P-Cores, dragging down the average. That's why I tested E-Core frequency scaling separately in the chart below. The E-Cores are basically running at 4.6 GHz all the time, unless the processor goes into some kind of throttle state. This screenshot from the BIOS confirms the clock scaling: 1 core active, under 70°C = 5.7 GHz 1 core active, over 70°C, or 2 cores active = 5.6 GHz 3 or more cores active = 5.4 GHz Overclocking Overclocking the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K is pretty easy, thanks to the unlocked multiplier. While temperatures and keeping them away from the throttle point have been a big gotcha with overclocking in the past, this is a complete non-issue now—the processor is easy to keep cool. Intel has also increased the TjMax to 105°C, which adds an extra +5°C in thermal headroom. You can manually increase this limit to 115°C. On AMD AM5 CPUs the limit is 95°C, with no option to increase. You can now adjust the voltage for the P-Cores and E-Cores separately, and also their overclocking frequencies. On top of that there are additional dials for the inter-tile clock frequency and others. The OC testing in this review is designed to represent what a typical user can achieve without in-depth knowledge of secret overclocking techniques or dozens of hours to tweak the system for a long time. I set the voltage offsets to +150 mV for both core types and started increasing the CPU multiplier for the P-Cores only. Here's another change, the frequency steps are much more fine-grained, down to 16 MHz. For the testing in this review I went in steps of 200 MHz first, and then 100 MHz, until the CPU was unstable. At this point (5.6 GHz), I tried to give it another bump in voltage, but I couldn't get it stable without risking damage to the CPU due to too high voltage, so I settled for 5.5 GHz, but that ended up with a little bit of thermal throttling, so I picked 5.4 GHz. This is considerably lower than the various boosts, which reach up to 5.7 GHz, so this all-core overclocking only helps with highly multithreaded workloads. It's important to note that Intel CPUs support per core overclocking, which can help with finding an overclocking profile that doesn't compromise. Next, I started working on the E-Cores. However, I first lowered the P-Cores' multiplier to ensure that any instability wouldn't disrupt the E-Core overclocking. E-Core overclocking topped out at 5.0 GHz—impressive, but it was a tiny bit unstable, so I dialed the clocks down another 100 MHz to 4.9 GHz. Performance Summary On this page, we're comparing the performance of the processors in our test group by showing their relative performance as a percentage. The charts highlight how each CPU stacks up against the others in our testing. Using percentages makes it easy to see which processors excel or lag in the benchmarks, with higher percentages indicating better relative performance. Performance per Dollar Below, we're plotting how much processing power you get for each dollar spent on various processors across our full suite of application benchmarks and non-gaming workloads. This comparison shows the value of each CPU by relating its performance in tasks like video editing, 3D rendering, or data processing to its cost. A higher value means you get more capability for your money, making that processor a better choice for handling demanding applications. Cost per Frame The following charts show how much you're expected to pay for each frame that's rendered, focusing only on the processor cost and ignoring power usage or other hardware expenses. It's important to consider both the reported cost per frame and the actual framerate you're getting. At higher resolutions, FPS differences between processors are smaller because the GPU becomes the bottleneck. The FPS numbers are based on the ""Average FPS"" results at a given resolution, combining performance data from all our game tests, both with and without ray tracing. Performance vs Core i9-14900K Performance vs Ryzen 9 9950X Performance vs Ryzen 9 7950X3D Value and Conclusion The Intel Core Ultra 9 285K will sell for $590. Excellent performance in heavy multithreaded apps Good energy efficiency Easy to keep cool PCIe Gen 5 SSD without compromising GPU bandwidth Overclocking unlocked Good memory support, well over DDR5-8000 Integrated GPU iGPU performance doubled vs Raptor Lake Support for Thunderbolt 4 & 5, Wi-Fi 6E & 7 NPU included 3 nanometer production process Gaming performance lower than expected, slower than Raptor Lake Some games and applications aren't currently performing well at all Requires new motherboard with Socket LGA1851 No more support for DDR4 memory No support for AVX-512 Technology & Positioning With the Core Ultra 200 series, Intel is launching a brand-new processor architecture for their desktop lineup. While traditionally, Intel non-mobile CPUs have been monolithic, single-die designs, Arrow Lake changes this completely. The new CPU is made up of four independent silicon ""tiles"" that come together to form a single processor. This is somewhat similar to AMD's Ryzen approach, but much more complex, because the tiles are so different, each with its own responsibility, while AMD has just the I/O die and the compute tiles. While AMD connects their tiles using Infinity Fabric, Intel leverages their Foveros technology and puts them onto yet another piece of silicon, called ""interposer,"" which allows much higher transfer rates, with more efficiency. Another major architectural change is that Intel's new microarchitecture does away with Hyper-Threading. In the past, this technology was used to effectively double the processor's thread count, but over time it turned out that it is a major source of security issues. Also, some workloads run better without HT, and there is a die area cost of implementation. Last but certainly not least, the E-Cores have been revamped, too, they now have access to the shared L3 cache and come with a major increase in IPC. In addition, the naming has been updated to indicate the evolution in Intel's architecture. Instead of Core i9-15900K, the processor in this review is called Core Ultra 9 285K. I'm not sure if that makes any difference for the average Joe on the street who thinks ""higher number is better,"" and enthusiasts will just get used to the new naming, no matter the actual scheme. Today we not only have reviews for the flagship Core Ultra 9 285K (this review), but also for the Core i7-equivalent, the Core Ultra 7 265K , and the Core Ultra 5 245K , which replaces the Core i5 in Intel's lineup. Application Performance Intel has been praising their new Lion Cove architecture for months now, and we finally have our own results. Overall application performance of the Core Ultra 9 285K is improved by 1.2% over the Core i9-14900K—not much. AMD's flagship, the Ryzen 9 9950X still wins, by a small 3.4% margin. Once we take a look at individual benchmarks we can see why Arrow Lake isn't winning more battles. In several of our tests, the new processors lag seriously behind the competition, sometimes by significant amounts . I'm not exactly sure yet what causes it, but my first guess would be mis-scheduling of threads, either to E-Cores or bouncing between cores too often. Interestingly, this happens mostly in light and medium workloads. Heavy workloads run very well and show how mighty these new P-Cores are. I'm also impressed by the performance results of our CPU-only AI testing (without NPU), it's amazing how well this new architecture deals with this kind of workload, even without Hyper-Threading. Increasing the power limit really doesn't make any substantial difference for Arrow Lake—these processors are not limited by power. DDR5 Memory & CUDIMM With the performance results in mind, I'd like to highlight here that we are running at a relatively slow DDR-6000 CL36, which was picked to ensure fairness for all tested platforms from both AMD and Intel—a common denominator that all systems can run pretty easily. Now that DDR5 memory has matured we're looking into faster memory options for the next full retest of the 40+ CPUs in our test group. For Arrow Lake specifically, you have to consider that this platform has excellent memory support with speeds in excess of 8000 MT/s, without any additional dividers. On AMD, beyond 6400 MT/s you'll have to run at a lower memory controller ratio, which needs a significantly higher memory clock to make up for the increased latency. On Arrow Lake, a higher divider is only needed for 8800+ MT/s, which means memory scales much better. I am working on a full memory scaling article, but for now, I've included some quick testing in the review for you to get an idea what to expect. The numbers confirm that 6000 CL36 isn't monumentally slower than 6000 CL30, but that there are good gains to be had with memory clocked at the limit of what's possible today. Gaming Performance If you thought application performance was a mixed bag, then take a look at the gaming numbers. Depending on the game, Arrow Lake can be near the top of our charts (Spider-Man), or near the bottom (Elden Ring). This is quite surprising, because we all expected these new P-Cores to breeze through games, especially, since there's no Hyper-Threading, which often lowers gaming performance a bit. I have no idea what causes these swings in gaming performance, but hopefully it's something that Intel can address in the near future. Compared to last generation's Raptor Lake 14900K, the Ultra 9 285K is around 5% slower at 1080p, 1.5% at 4K. AMD's Zen 5 offers roughly the same performance, but AMD has the X3D ace up their sleeves. The 7800X3D remains the undisputed best gaming processor in the world, and the 9800X3D is launching very soon, too—unless AMD f'ed that up big time I am sure that it will take the gaming crown. Do consider these FPS differences though—5%—not much. At 100 FPS that's 5 FPS more—subjectively, you'll never notice any difference between these processors. They are all very good for gaming, and you should probably look at options with pricing in mind, too. Ryzen 9600X ($250), 7700X ($280), 14600K ($260), 13700K ($280) are all competitively priced with lots of choice in the segment—around $200 cheaper than the 7800X3D ($470), and I'm sure that AMD will make you pay for the 9800X3D. Integrated Graphics With the Core Ultra 200 Series, Intel is introducing a revamped iGPU, which is built on a more modern architecture. I'm happy to report that the performance has roughly doubled (!) compared to Raptor Lake—good job! While you still can't play AAA gaming with the integrated GPU, light gaming won't be a problem at all. You also get accelerated video playback with wide codec support and Quick Sync for an exceptional media encoding experience. Any sort of productivity, Internet browsing, Office, Photoshop will run perfectly fine of course, too. Power Consumption One of the main targets of Intel's new architecture is to bring down power consumption, and I can confirm that Intel has achieved that goal. On average, in our mix of 49 applications, the 285K consumed 132 W while the 14900K used 180 W—very nice, a 30% reduction. Gaming power is down a bit, too, by roughly 50 W, too, down to 94 W, the predecessor consumed 149 W. Compared to AMD's Zen 5 offerings, the power profile is comparable, ""close enough"" I would say. For gaming specifically, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D is the best choice for energy efficiency, though, using roughly half the power of the 285K while offering more FPS at the same time. You do have to consider that Intel is on a 3 nanometer process whereas AMD uses slightly less efficient 4 nanometer—both from TSMC. With our 2024 Test Suite we've added full system idle power consumption measurements, here Intel can impress with Arrow Lake, too, just like with their older architectures. Compared to AMD, the difference is around 25 W, which can add up when your PC is running many hours each day. Cooling Requirements In the past, Intel's high-end processors were difficult to cool—this is a total non-issue now. Thanks to improvements in energy efficiency the heat output is lower, and that heat isn't as concentrated anymore, because the P-Cores are spread out over a larger area. You can keep the 285K cool at stock easily, even with a standard high-end air cooler. Intel's decision to increase the thermal limit to 105°C allows for more headroom, while still maintaining a full warranty for 24/7 use. AMD uses a 95°C thermal limit, which paired with the thicker IHS makes their processors more difficult to cool, despite the slightly lower heat output. If you plan on serious overclocking, especially with voltage increases you'll definitely want good cooling, a decent AIO should do the trick here. Overclocking Just like in previous generations, Intel uses the ""K"" suffix to denote overclockable processors—is that really still needed? AMD gives you unlocked multipliers across the board. While overclocking is easy, and there are some new dials to play with, at the end of the day it really doesn't make much of a difference. I'm sure in the coming weeks we will learn more about how to boost performance. Interesting topics are D2D (die-to-die) and NGU (Next Generation Uncore), Ring, and of course everything related to thread scheduling and memory performance. The ""classic"" CPU multiplier increases won't make much of a difference, as the CPU is running pretty close to its maximum limits already, but per core overclocking can provide better than stock performance in all scenarios. I am working on more OC testing right now and will update this review ASAP. Platform Arrow Lake brings with it a new platform with a new chipset, new socket, and new motherboards. I really like that you can finally use a PCIe Gen 5 SSD without compromising on the GPU's PCIe lanes—with previous platforms the GPU dropped to x8 when a CPU-attached M.2 SSD was installed. Of course, you're also getting all the latest tech features like modern USB, Wi-Fi, Thunderbolt, etc. While in the past, such platform transitions have been very smooth with Intel, this time things felt much less refined. Throughout the last two weeks of testing, we have seen five separate BIOS versions, and I'm certain more will follow in the upcoming weeks. Personally, I encountered strange memory instability, where slots 1 and 3 would barely run at DDR5-5600. As soon as the modules were moved to the recommended slots 2 and 4, speeds of 8000+ MT/s were possible with the exact same settings and BIOS. Running four memory modules at high speeds is very difficult, you'll usually end up sub-6000 with four DIMMs, perhaps CUDIMMs will shake this up. Many new BIOS options were introduced, but the motherboards currently lack useful descriptions for these items in the UEFI settings, which will make you feel lost at first. When pairing Windows 24H2 with Arrow Lake, performance will be terrible—we've seen games running at 50% the FPS vs 23H2. One solution is to turn off Thread Director or disable the ""Balanced"" power profile, which is why we decided to use 23H2 for the time being. Last but not least, there are some driver issues and bluescreens when both a dGPU and iGPU are active at the same time. To me, this experience felt a bit like AMD Ryzen 1st generation, but I'm confident that Intel can solve all these issues, like AMD did. While Raptor Lake supported both DDR4 and DDR5, Arrow Lake focuses on DDR5 exclusively, which makes a lot of sense to me now that memory prices have reached reasonable levels. Pairing the platform with faster memory definitely helps gain more performance, which is an advantage for Intel over AMD, because you can run faster memory with Intel (if you're willing to pay the premium for it). We've seen very long boot times from AMD's AM5 processors in the past, and it seems that this is something that AMD can't really fix conclusively. On Core Ultra 200 POST times feel very similar to previous generations, ""fast,"" no matter if booting from power disconnected or doing a cold or warm reboot. NPU Intel's new Arrow Lake processors all come with an NPU, which accelerates AI operations. Right now, this is a rare scenario—most AI experiences are cloud-based or run on the CPU/GPU. But going forward, I'm sure that we will see more and more vendors port their algorithms to run on NPUs, which could give such systems an advantage, mostly in terms of power efficiency. When it comes to raw compute horsepower, the GPU and CPU will have the upper hand for a long time, and the hardware/API ecosystem is quite fragmented right now. At this time, having an NPU in a desktop really makes no tangible difference, but this could change in the future. Pricing & Alternatives According to Intel, the Core Ultra 9 285K will sell for $590, which is the same launch price as last generation's Core i9-14900K. I'm definitely not impressed. Right now, there are so many performance gotchas with Arrow Lake that it's hard to recommend, especially when lacking a clear pricing advantage. No doubt, some application scenarios run really well on Core Ultra 200, and if you run these, do consider it, but for gamers there are lots of good alternatives to the Core Ultra 9 285K which not only are more affordable, but also offer (slightly) better performance. If you really want to play with Arrow Lake, do consider the Core Ultra 7 265K, which costs just $395, or $200 less, yet lacks only four E-Cores and runs slightly lower clocks overall. In terms of performance you're losing single digits in both apps and gaming, which isn't so bad considering an almost 50% difference in pricing. AMD's Zen 5 hasn't been selling well at all, because it doesn't offer significant improvements over Zen 4, and AMD just announced a price cut. I suspect that Core Ultra 200 will suffer the same fate. Upgrading really isn't attractive these days, especially not with those crazy motherboard prices. For the vast majority of people I would strongly suggest waiting a few months to ensure platform maturity. Upcoming Releases AMD has already declared that their new Ryzen 9800X3D is coming on November 7th, which will probably set new records for gaming performance, and it won't be cheap. In 2025, we expect Intel to announce non-K Arrow Lake processors, with lower TDPs at lower price points. I think at this time the platform will have matured a lot, and Microsoft will have had some time to fix Windows 11 24H2. Beyond that would be Zen 6 and Panther Lake, which will arrive in late 2025 at the earliest, so nothing to get excited about yet. We can only hope that the prices for the new Arrow Lake and Zen 5 platforms will decrease in the coming months, encouraging more customers to adopt them. I mentioned this before, but Arrow Lake reminds me so much of Zen 1, first generation Ryzen. Looking back, somehow that feels like an opportunity, because it establishes a new baseline design that sets a foundation for the coming generations of Intel processors. For me, there's more coverage for Arrow Lake to work on: DDR5 Memory Scaling, P-Cores Only Performance and E-Cores Only Performance are my personal highlights that I'm looking forward to exploring, so stay tuned.Today, we can finally take the covers off Intel's latest CPU generation, the ""Core Ultra"" series, codenamed Arrow Lake. The Arrow Lake architecture is new for desktop systems, using a tile-based processor design, with the goal of moving away from a large monolithic chip based on the latest node and instead splitting the CPU into blocks, or ""tiles,"" as they're commonly referred to. This approach allows Intel to develop the CPU cores and iGPU using cutting-edge nodes, while other aspects of the processor, such as I/O interfaces, can be built using an older, more cost-effective node. This approach is similar to what AMD has been doing with Ryzen . Since Arrow Lake represents such a radical change from the previous Raptor Lake generation, we could spend a lot of time discussing the architectural and platform changes, some of which we've been covering over time in anticipation for this release. However, since most of you are here for the benchmarks and actual performance results, we'll quickly go over the flagship CPU we're testing today, touch on the new platform, and then dive into the graphs. Meet the new Core Ultra 9 285K The new flagship is the Core Ultra 9 285K. Yes, it's not the best name, and yes, the 'Ultra' is unnecessary, but Intel is just following the trend – modern product names tend to be unnecessarily long and somewhat uninspired, so that box is checked. The 285K features 8 P-Cores with 8 threads, as Hyper-Threading is no longer used. These P-Cores have a base frequency of 3.7 GHz, boosting up to 5.6 GHz, with a thermal velocity boost of 5.7 GHz – resulting in a 5% frequency reduction compared to the 14900K . There are also 16 E-Cores, each with 1 thread, as there is no SMT support here. These E-Cores operate at a base frequency of 3.2 GHz, with a boost up to 4.6 GHz, which is a 5% increase over the E-Cores in the 14900K. Processor Release price P-core (performance) E-core (efficiency) L3 cache Cores (threads) Freq. Turbo L2 cache Cores (threads) Freq. Turbo L2 cache Core Ultra 9 285K $600 8 (8) 3.7 GHz 5.6 GHz 24 MB 16 (16) 3.2 GHz 4.6 GHz 16 MB 36 MB Core Ultra 7 265K $395 8 (8) 3.9 GHz 5.5 GHz 12 (12) 3.3 GHz 12 MB 30 MB Core Ultra 5 245K $310 6 (6) 4.2 GHz 5.2 GHz 18 MB 8 (8) 3.6 GHz 8 MB 24 MB Core i9-14900K $600 8 (16) 3.2 GHz 6.0 GHz 16 MB 16 (16) 2.4 GHz 4.4 GHz 16 MB 36 MB Core i7-14700K $420 8 (16) 3.4 GHz 5.6 GHz 12 (12) 2.5 GHz 4.3 GHz 12 MB 33 MB Core i5-14600K $330 6 (12) 3.5 GHz 5.3 GHz 12 MB 8 (8) 2.6 GHz 4.0 GHz 8 MB 24 MB In total, there are 36 MB of L3 cache and 40 MB of L2 cache. Each P-Core gets 3 MB of L2 cache, while the E-Cores are grouped into clusters of four, with each cluster sharing 4 MB of L2 cache. Finally, the base TDP is 125W, with a max turbo TDP of 250W. Intel is pricing this at $590 per 1,000 units, so we expect an initial retail price of at least $600. It's also worth noting that all K-SKU models, which are the only ones announced so far, support dual-channel DDR5-5600 UDIMM memory or DDR5-6400 CUDIMM memory. CUDIMM memory includes a small clock driver circuit directly on the module, enabling more precise timings required at higher memory speeds. All CPUs provide 20 PCIe 5.0 lanes and 4 PCIe 4.0 lanes, along with an 8-lane Direct Media Interface 4.0 bus to the chipset. As usual, the K-suffix processors have an unlocked multiplier, making them ideal for overclocking. A New Socket With Arrow Lake, Intel has moved away from the LGA1700 socket, switching to LGA1851. Despite the increased pin count, the new socket maintains the same dimensions and cooler mounting hole spacing as LGA1700, ensuring continued compatibility with existing CPU coolers. For testing, we used a number of new motherboards, primarily the Asus ROG Maximus Z890 Hero and MSI MEG Z890 Unify-X. A substantial number of BIOS updates were needed to achieve the performance figures we're about to present, so it's fair to say the Arrow Lake review process has been far from smooth. Testing Notes First, to be transparent, we had very limited time to prepare this review, as Intel only sent us the review kit three days before the embargo lifted. Three days is not enough time to run all the tests we'd like to, so some tests will be covered in follow-up content. Since these CPUs will be available for purchase on October 24th, we wanted to have a review ready to help guide your buying decisions. However, delays in receiving review samples turned out to be the least of our concerns, as Arrow Lake is currently a bit of a hot mess, so much so that we're not sure where to start. Let's start with Windows 11. Many of you know that Windows 11 24H2 was released a few weeks ago, significantly improving gaming performance for modern Ryzen processors in some cases. It even benefits 13th and 14th-gen Intel models. However, when updating our data, we noticed that 12th-gen Intel CPUs performed noticeably worse on 24H2 compared to 23H2. This issue wasn't limited to 12th-gen processors. We encountered serious performance and stability problems with Arrow Lake on 24H2. After multiple fresh installs failed to resolve the issue, we had to revert to testing on 23H2. This is less than ideal, as we know some games perform worse on the older version of Windows 11. Even with a fresh 23H2 install, we still experienced stability issues with the 285K. Games would occasionally crash, as would certain applications. The problem was worse when using the DDR5-8200 memory provided for testing. This persisted even after numerous BIOS revisions for two different motherboards. We expect these teething issues will be addressed quickly, though we are unsure why 24H2 caused so many problems. It's particularly odd because Intel reportedly did all their benchmarking on 24H2 using the Insider Preview build from August and did not report any issues. Nevertheless, we've spoken with multiple reviewers who also encountered problems, even with 23H2, and board manufacturers confirmed there are issues with 24H2. Test System Specs Before we get into the benchmark data, here are the test specs and systems used. One thing to note is that we benchmarked the 285K with both DDR5-7200 and DDR5-8200 memory. CPU Motherboard Memory AMD Ryzen 7000 Series Gigabyte X670E Aorus Master [BIOS F33d] G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 32GB DDR5-6000 CL30-38-38-96 Windows 11 24H2 AMD Ryzen 5000 Series MSI MPG X570S Carbon MAX WiFi [BIOS 7D52v19] G.Skill Ripjaws V Series 32GB DDR4-3600 CL14-15-15-35 Windows 11 24H2 Intel Core Ultra 200S Asus ROG Maximus Z890 Hero [BIOS 0805] G.Skill Trident Z5 CK 32GB DDR5-8200 CL40-52-52-131 G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 32GB DDR5-7200 CL34-45-45-115 Windows 11 23H2 [24H2 = Slower] Intel 12th, 13th & 14th MSI MPG Z790 Carbon WiFi [BIOS 7D89v1E] G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 32GB DDR5-7200 CL34-45-45-115 Windows 11 23H2 [24H2 = Slower] Graphics Card Power Supply Storage Asus ROG Strix RTX 4090 OC Edition Kolink Regulator Gold ATX 3.0 1200W TeamGroup T-Force Cardea A440 M.2 PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD 4TB GeForce Game Ready Driver 565.90 WHQL The 7200 CL34 memory runs with much tighter timings compared to the DDR5-8200 CL40 memory. If an application or game is more latency-sensitive, the 7200 memory may perform better. However, if bandwidth is the limiting factor, the 8200 kit might have the advantage. Now, let's see how the numbers shake out... Productivity Benchmarks Cinebench Clock Behavior First, let's take a look at how the 285K behaves under load. For cooling, we are using the new MSI MAG Coreliquid I360, which was provided in our review kit and is specifically designed and optimized for the new Arrow Lake CPUs. MSI has developed a unique bracket that shifts the cold plate north, resulting in a 3-degree reduction in temperature as it better targets the hotspot on these new CPUs. A nice feature of this design is that the unique mounting bracket also provides optimal coverage for LGA1700, AM4, and even AM5 processors, making it a versatile, one-size-fits-all solution. With the Coreliquid I360 installed, we loaded up the 285K with Cinebench and observed an average clock frequency of 4.6 GHz on the E-Cores and 5.3 GHz on the P-Cores, all while staying within the stock 250W power limit. The CPU reached a peak core temperature of 84°C, which is well below the 105°C TjMAX. Cinebench 2024, Multi Core Now for the benchmark graphs: the Cinebench multi-core performance looks very strong. We already know that E-Cores work well in this type of workload, based on previous models. The E-Cores in the 285K are based on an updated architecture and run at slightly higher clock speeds. Using either DDR5-7200 or 8200 memory, we saw a score of just over 2,500 points, making the 285K 14% faster than the 14900K and 7% faster than the 9950X. Cinebench 2024, Single Core When we look at single-core performance, the Arrow Lake P-Cores continue to impress, with the 285K being 13% faster than the 14900K and 6% faster than the 9950X – another great result. Cinebench 2024 Power Consumption Next, let's discuss power consumption. This part of the review gave us some trouble, but thanks to Steve from Gamers Nexus , we were able to catch an issue with the testing. The Asus ROG Maximus Z890 Hero has a unique design: instead of delivering all the CPU power through the dual EPS12V rails, four of the vCore power stages are connected to the 24-pin ATX power cable. Initially, we were puzzled as to why the 285K, with a 250W limit, was drawing only 196W. After Gamers Nexus alerted us to this, we confirmed that about 50-60W of power was being supplied via the 24-pin ATX cable. This was later confirmed by Asus engineers. After retesting with the MSI MEG Z890 Unify-X, we confirmed the correct EPS12V data, showing the 285K drawing 258W during this test. While this is an improvement over the 14900K, it's not particularly impressive, considering the 9950X was only 7% slower but consumed 11% less power. Even more concerning is that the 7950X3D was just 13% slower than the 285K but used a massive 43% less power. However, compared to the highly inefficient 14900K, the 285K represents a step in the right direction, consuming 17% less power while delivering 14% more performance. 7-Zip File Manager Compression When it comes to compression performance, the 285K is solid, but not groundbreaking. It performs similarly to the 14900K, 9950X, and 7950X. While it's not a huge leap forward for a new generation, it's certainly not a bad result. 7-Zip File Manager Decompression However, decompression performance is quite weak, largely due to the removal of SMT. As a result, when using the same frequency memory, the 285K is 9% slower than the 14900K and a significant 25% slower than the 9950X. Blender Open Data The Blender Open Data results are good, though not exceptional, as the 285K matches the 9950X. However, given the improved power efficiency, this is still a positive outcome overall. Corona 10 Benchmark In the Corona 10 Benchmark, the 285K performs well, though it's 9% slower than the 9950X, despite showing a 17% performance increase over the 14900K. Adobe Photoshop 2025 Despite the impressive single-core scores seen in Cinebench, the 285K's performance in the lightly threaded Photoshop benchmark is disappointing. It's slightly slower than the Core i5-12600K, making it one of the slowest CPUs we've tested in this benchmark, which is both puzzling and disappointing. Adobe Premiere Pro 2024 Fortunately, performance in Adobe Premiere Pro is much better, though still slightly behind the 14900K. This result, while better, is still underwhelming for a next-generation product. Gaming Benchmarks Let's dive into the gaming benchmarks, starting with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Ryzen processors received a notable performance boost in this title with Windows 11 24H2. While the gains for 14th-gen Intel processors were smaller, they were still present. Unfortunately, parts like the 285K are currently around 5-10% slower on 24H2, so the 285K data presented here was gathered using 23H2. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Ignoring the X3D CPUs, which are blazing fast in this test, the Intel 285K delivered fairly mid-range performance, coming in 4% slower than the 14900K. Additionally, the lower-latency DDR5-7200 memory was slightly faster than the 8200 memory in this case. The Last of Us Part 1 The 285K performed impressively in The Last of Us Part 1 , delivering performance comparable to the 7800X3D and slightly faster than the 14900K. However, with the same 7200 memory, we only observed a 2% improvement, which is underwhelming for a next-gen product. Some might even call it a disappointment. Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty This is where things really go off the rails. You might see reviews where the 285K performs similarly to the 14900K in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty , but those reviews likely used the built-in benchmark or tested sections of the game that aren't very CPU-intensive. We have evidence for this, which we will explain later. In more CPU-demanding sections of the game, the 285K struggles significantly. We've spent considerable time attempting to extract more performance in this test, with the best results coming from lower-latency memory, where tightening timings helped the most. However, despite testing motherboards from MSI, Gigabyte, Asrock, and Asus, and even performing multiple fresh Windows installs, the 285K remained at least 20% slower than the 14900K, making it the slowest CPU in this test. Hogwarts Legacy Performance in Hogwarts Legacy is better, but still poor overall. The 285K lagged behind the 14900K, making it slower than even the Ryzen 7 7700X . It's surprising to see how much Windows 11 23H2 was holding back Zen 4 and Zen 5 processors, as we now regularly find the 7700X matching the 14900K's performance. Additionally, the Intel CPU is no longer running without power limits. Assetto Corsa Competizione In ACC, the 285K fell behind the 14900K by 5%, making it 14% slower than the 9700X and 32% slower than the 7950X3D, meaning Arrow Lake is not an ideal choice for this driving simulator. Remnant II Remnant II produced data closer to what Intel had promised, with the 1% lows being significantly better on the 285K compared to the 14900K. However, despite matching Intel's previous flagship, the 285K still trailed behind the Zen 4 X3D parts. Homeworld 3 Another game where the 285K's performance falls to the bottom of the chart is Homeworld 3. In this test, the 285K delivered Core i5-12600K -like performance, making it almost 20% slower than the 14900K and 7950X3D, and at least 23% slower than the 9700X . A Plague Tale: Requiem Performance in A Plague Tale: Requiem is also shocking. If you've seen other reviews showing much better results in this title, we'll explain the discrepancy later. For now, the 285K is underwhelming, allowing for just over 120 fps on average, with 1% lows in the mid-70s. It's at least 17% slower than the 14900K and 27% slower than the 7950X3D, again delivering Core i5-12600K-like performance, making it even slower than the Ryzen 5 7600X . Counter-Strike 2 In Counter-Strike 2, the results align more closely with Intel's promises, with the 285K roughly matching the 14900K. While it's good to see this kind of parity, it's far from the norm based on our other tests, and still an underwhelming result overall. Starfield Interestingly, the 285K delivered its best performance in Starfield , narrowly beating the 14900K and even surpassing the 7950X3D . However, using the same memory, it was only 2% faster than the 14900K, which, while one of the better results we've seen, is still disappointing for a new generation. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Space Marine 2 ran fine on the 285K, though this new flagship only offered mid-tier performance, coming in slower than the 14700K and roughly matching the Ryzen 7 7700X. It's not a disaster, but far from impressive. Hitman 3 The 285K performed decently in Hitman 3, being one of the fastest CPUs in this title. However, it was still slightly slower than the 14900K – by just 2% – so it's hard to get too excited about this result, as we're looking at 14700K-like performance. Watch Dogs: Legion For testing Watch Dogs: Legion, we used the built-in benchmark, but averaged the data from six runs, as the initial results are often inflated. To accurately compare with this data, you'll need to take an average of six back-to-back runs. Doing so reveals extremely disappointing results for the 285K, which only matched the 14600K and 9600X with 162 fps on average. This made it 11% slower than the 14900K and 20% slower than the 7950X3D. Star Wars Outlaws Finally, in Star Wars Outlaws , the lower-latency DDR5-7200 memory provided the best results, with 134 fps – the same performance level as the 12900K. And with that, we conclude our highly disappointing gaming benchmarks. Side-by-Side Data To recap, here's how the 14900K and 285K compared, both using DDR5-7200 memory. On average, the 285K was 6% slower across the 14 games we tested, with significant losses in Watch Dogs: Legion, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Homeworld 3, and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty . Gaming Power Consumption Arrow Lake makes significant strides in power efficiency, and while it's much improved over the 14900K, the results still fall short when compared to Ryzen processors. In our Cyberpunk testing, we observed a substantial 32% reduction in power usage for the 285K compared to the 14900K. However, it still consumed 28% more power than the 9950X, and performance for the 285K was poor in this title. Let's now look at a game where the 285K performed better. In The Last of Us Part 1, the 285K consumed 32% less power than the 14900K, which is impressive given it was a few percent faster. Unfortunately, when compared to the 7950X3D, the 285K used 71% more power for the same level of performance, which is disappointing. While Intel has made improvements in power efficiency, reducing power consumption by almost 70W from the 14900K, it still lags behind AMD, especially at the current performance levels. 14 Game Average Looking at the 14-game average, we see that the 285K is 5% slower than the 14900K, when calculating using the geometric mean. This means that, on average, it's slightly slower than the 7700X and about on par with the 9600X, which is quite surprising. It's also 14% slower than the 7950X3D. Here, we see just how much Ryzen processors have benefited from the 24H2 update, with the 7800X3D being 14% faster than the 14900K, which is remarkable. Of course, we are now power-limiting the Core i9, but even so, that margin is impressive. Cost Per Frame Typically, our cost-per-frame analysis for CPUs includes the cost of the motherboard and memory, but in this case, the prices for those components are quite similar. While this may reduce the overall margins slightly, the picture is clear: the 285K offers poor value for gamers. It provides similar value to the 9950X, making it much worse than the 7950X3D, which is probably the best all-rounder at the moment. It also performs worse than the outgoing 14900K, which we have never recommended. Interestingly, the 7800X3D, which has sold for as little as $340 this year, still offers far better value at $480. Even with recent price increases, the 7800X3D remains a strong contender in terms of value. Windows 24H2 Gaming Performance As mentioned earlier, Arrow Lake's gaming performance was even worse on Windows 11 24H2. Intel is aware of this issue and has suggested enabling the 'high performance' or 'high power' profile in Windows for optimal performance on 24H2. They also speculated that there might be an issue with the ring bus clock on 24H2, suggesting a BIOS change by disabling the 'CCF Auto GV' setting. We explored these suggestions using a limited set of gaming benchmarks to see the impact. Additionally, we included a fresh install of Windows 10, as many users still rely on this OS and may be curious about the 285K's performance on it. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Looking at the 23H2 data, the 285K's performance improved by 3% when using Windows 10, which is a good sign. However, it's likely that parts like the 14900K would see a similar or possibly greater performance uplift. Using the default 24H2 configuration with the balanced power profile severely hindered the 285K, reducing the average frame rate by 8% compared to 23H2, with the 1% lows dropping by 36%. Clearly, something is wrong here. Switching to the 'high performance' power plan improved the frame rate to 150 fps on average, though still below what we saw with 23H2, but a notable improvement nonetheless. Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty In Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty , the 285K performed best using 23H2, with a slight frame drop when using Windows 10, though the difference was within the margin of error. Interestingly, the 24H2 balanced power plan performed better here, as the frame rate regressed by 3% when switching to the high performance profile. Adjusting the 'CCF Auto GV' setting had no impact, similar to what we saw in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Homeworld 3 The Homeworld 3 data underscores just how erratic the Arrow Lake testing has been, though the results align with expectations. We know Homeworld 3 performs poorly on 23H2, while 24H2 significantly boosts performance for Intel's 13th and 14th-gen and AMD Ryzen processors. The fact that Windows 10 performed 20% better than 23H2 makes sense in this context. What doesn't make sense initially is the lack of improvement on 24H2 for the 285K – until you manually adjust the power plan. After doing so, the performance matched the Core i7-14700K . Unfortunately for Intel, we have to choose a single OS configuration for testing, and there seems to be no perfect option where everything works as it should, at least not at this time. A Plague Tale: Requiem Performance in A Plague Tale: Requiem was disappointing on the 285K, and switching to 24H2 didn't resolve the issue. Oddly, Windows 10 performed poorly in this title, though this was a trend we observed in a few of the 14 games tested. Counter-Strike 2 In Counter-Strike 2, the performance on 23H2 matched what we saw with Windows 10. However, 24H2 was consistently slower, though switching to the high performance power profile provided a small boost. Intel APO Optimization Lastly, it's important to note that all the gaming benchmarks you just saw were run without Intel's APO (Application Optimization) feature enabled. This feature was not enabled by default during our testing, but Intel has indicated that this will be addressed in future BIOS updates. We didn't focus on this for two reasons. First, out of the 14 games we tested, only two – Counter-Strike 2 and Cyberpunk 2077 – support APO. Second, out of curiosity, we went back and enabled APO in those games and found only a 1-2% change in performance, which falls within the margin of error. This suggests that either APO has minimal impact on those titles, or it isn't fully functional yet. We will revisit this feature in future content to see if there are any significant updates or improvements. What We Learned: Inconsistent Gaming Performance So, there we have it – a chaotic mix of results that often don't seem to make much sense. Clearly, Intel has a significant number of issues to resolve, and while we didn't expect them to flawlessly execute a new platform and CPU architecture release, we had hoped for a much more polished product. Depending on the hardware and software configuration, stability can be an issue, though we expect this to be addressed fairly quickly. However, it's something worth keeping in mind. We notified Intel about the poor gaming performance, and while they've offered a few solutions, none have worked to a degree that we find satisfactory. As it stands, gaming performance is inconsistent, to say the least. Overall, this is very disappointing for a next-generation flagship product. If Intel can't make significant improvements, Arrow Lake could end up being a poor choice for gaming. In terms of productivity, the 285K performs better, but it's still not exceptional. While there are certainly workloads where it excels, there are many where its performance is underwhelming compared to the 14900K and 9950X . One area where the 285K has massively improved over the 14900K is power efficiency, which is great news. However, in most cases, it's still far from where it needs to be to truly compete with AMD. The price is also problematic. It's expected to be around $600+, which is far too high. For the same amount, you can get the 9950X or the 7950X3D , and even the 7950X is cheaper at $510 . Any one of those AMD CPUs would be a better choice in our opinion. Even if Intel manages to fully resolve stability issues, fix performance on Windows 11 24H2, and address the inconsistent gaming results, the 285K would still only warrant a price tag of about $500. So, given all that, we're obviously not recommending the Core Ultra 9 285K at this time, and likely won't until these issues are resolved. As for overclocking, given all the current problems and the need to test performance across multiple versions of Windows, we deprioritized overclocking for this initial review. It's something we'll no doubt cover in future content, but for now, it's somewhat irrelevant given the number of issues that need to be addressed first. Memory overclocking is another topic, and while the review kits came with DDR5-8200 CUDIMM memory, it doesn't make much sense due to the extreme price and limited performance gains. We're unsure of the exact cost of this memory, but we know standard UDIMM kits are priced near $300 for a 24GB kit, so the CUDIMM kits will likely be even more expensive. Therefore, something like DDR5-7200 CL34, priced around $115, seems to be a more reasonable option. Once the issues we've discussed are addressed, we'll look into memory scaling to determine the optimal memory support for Arrow Lake. Wrapping this review up, we think there is potential for Arrow Lake to get a lot better as it appears under cooked at this stage. While we strongly recommend not rushing out to buy into Intel's new platform right now, we're not willing to write it off completely just yet."
2,INTEL i7 14700k,"Introduction Intel today debuted the 14th Gen Core desktop processor series codenamed Raptor Lake Refresh, and the new Core i7-14700K is the biggest beneficiary of this refresh. This latest Core i7 joins a long line of predecessors that have received a CPU core count uplift with each generation—the i7-11700K was an 8-core/16-thread chip, followed by the i7-12700K, which was 8P+4E (or 12-core/20-thread); and the i7-13700K was 8P+8E (or 16-core/24-thread). The new Core i7-14700K is 8P+12E (or 20-core/28-thread). The new Raptor Lake Refresh line of processors are just that—a refresh. There is no new silicon, no hardware-level changes, but just generational clock speed uplifts for each SKU compared to its predecessor from the 13th Gen, the addition of a couple of features for the Core i9-14900K; but the Core i7-14700K is the most interesting part from the three processor models Intel is launching today. Besides clock speeds and and additional cores in case of the Core i7, the 14th Gen core processors are also said to come with updates to the memory controller that supports even higher DDR5 speeds, especially when using 12 GB and 24 GB DIMMs. The Raptor Lake Refresh silicon is built on the same Intel 7 process node as its predecessor, it physically features 8 Raptor Cove P-cores (performance cores), 16 Gracemont E-cores (efficiency cores), organized in 4-core clusters, and 36 MB of L3 cache that's shared among the P-cores and E-core clusters. Each P-core has 2 MB of dedicated L2 cache, while each E-core cluster shares a 4 MB L2 cache among its cores. Intel carved the i7-14700K out of this die by enabling 3 out of 4 E-core clusters, giving the chip 33 MB of L3 cache. Besides more cores, the Core i7-14700K comes with a slight clock speed increase over the i7-13700K. The P-cores have a base frequency of 3.40 GHz, with a maximum boost frequency of 5.60 GHz, which it reaches using the Turbo Boost Max 3.0 algorithm, this is a 200 MHz generational speed bump. The E-cores get a slight clock speed increase, too, with 2.50 GHz base frequency, and 4.30 GHz turbo. Perhaps the best aspect of Core i7 chips from these past two generations, is that they've enjoyed power limits on par with the Core i9 parts from their respective generations. The i7-14700K gets a maximum turbo power (MTP) of 253 W, on par with that of the i9-14900K. With one less E-core cluster to feed, there's slightly improved boost residency for all cores. Intel is pricing the Core i7-14700K at $409, but you can save $25 by opting for the i7-14700KF, if you don't need integrated graphics, and spend the savings on a slightly better memory kit or motherboard. What's New with Raptor Lake Refresh At the heart of the 14th Gen Core processors being launched this week, is the new ""Raptor Lake Refresh"" monolithic processor silicon. This is physically the same silicon as the current ""Raptor Lake"" silicon powering the 13th Gen Core series. The new 14th Gen Core series is built on a generational increase in CPU core clock speeds for both the P-cores and E-cores, the introduction of the new Intel Application Optimization technology that we'll talk a bit more about later; and bolstering the Core i7 SKUs with four additional E-cores, to improve its multi-threaded performance against segment rivals. The i9-14900K/KF in particular, features the Thermal Velocity Boost feature, which rewards good CPU cooling with the highest boost frequencies of 6.00 GHz. In addition to these CPU clock speed bumps, Intel says that it has tweaked the memory controllers to support even higher DDR5 memory speeds, particularly when using 12 GB and 24 GB DIMMs. Although the company did not introduce a new chipset with these processors, nearly every motherboard vendor for the LGA1700 platform has introduced new motherboard models based on the 700-series chipset, which come with out of the box support for these processors, and a few new platform features such as Wi-Fi 7. All existing 700-series and 600-series chipset motherboards support these processors, some require UEFI firmware updates provided by motherboard vendors. ""Intel Application Optimization"" or just ""APO"" is an extension of Intel's Dynamic Tuning Technology (DTT) that's game-specific. The feature is available on select 14th Gen Core processor models, such as the i9-14900K/KF, and provides a means for Dynamic Tuning Technology to improve workload allocation to the various hardware resources, such as the P-cores, and back them with the highest possible frequencies. Intel claims that the feature can result in frame-rate improvements that can be as high as 13% in ""Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"" or even up to 16% in ""Metro Exodus."" Intel application Optimization works by optimizing the machine's thread scheduling and manages application resource allocation in real-time. APO is supported in just two games at this time. Going forward, Intel promises to test a lot of games and add APO profiles where gains can be found. We asked Intel whether profiles can be created or customized by the user, and whether Linux is supported. The answer was ""not at this time"" to both questions. With the latest version of Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU), Intel is introducing an exclusive feature for 14th Gen Unlocked K processors, called AI Assist. At launch, this feature is exclusive to the i9-14900K/KF, but Intel is working to extend it to other 14th Gen Core processor models. Adding support for each new processor model entails rigorous testing and validation, which is why the feature isn't globally available for all 12th-thru-14th Gen processors. AI assist is an AI-based automated performance tuning feature that uses a pre-trained AI DNN to understand your machine, and figure out the best possible settings. Raptor Lake Architecture The ""Raptor Lake"" microarchitecture, as we mentioned, is the swansong of monolithic silicon client processors for Intel. Future generations will implement the IDM 2.0 product design, and will be multi-chip modules with chiplets built across various foundry nodes. The ""Raptor Lake"" silicon is fabricated on the same Intel 7 (10 nm Enhanced SuperFin) foundry node as the previous-gen ""Alder Lake,"" although Intel claims to have squeezed out a handful of improvements, such as better electron channel mobility, which can let both the P-cores and E-cores gain increases in clock speeds by as much as 600 MHz over the previous-generation, with minimally higher power. The transistor-density is unchanged, since it's the same the node. The ""Raptor Lake"" die measures 23.8 mm x 11.8 mm (257 mm² die-area). The channel mobility improvements on the Intel 7 node in particular lets the chip designers raise the V/F curve, with over 50 mV reduction in iso-frequency (voltage needed for frequency); over 200 MHz iso-voltage (frequency increase at a given voltage); which enables an up to 600 MHz increase in Turbo Boost frequencies, with the increase of maximum turbo power (MTP) to as high as 253 W for the Core i9-14900K and i7-14700K; and as high as 181 W for the Core i5-14600K. The ""Raptor Cove"" performance cores (P-cores) come with increased IPC over the 12th Gen, and while the company didn't specify the IPC gain over the previous-generation ""Golden Cove"" P-core, it mentions an over 15% single-threaded performance uplift. The ISA of the ""Raptor Cove"" core is identical to that of ""Golden Cove,"" but the company has enhanced the hardware prefetcher dealing with the dedicated L2 cache. Helping the P-core performance uplift are the node improvements that help it sustain higher frequencies, and larger dedicated L2 cache—now 2 MB compared to 1.25 MB for ""Golden Cove."" The i9-14900K and i7-14700K get eight ""Raptor Cove"" P-cores, which come with HyperThreading enabled, so 16 threads from the P-cores. The Core i5-14600K gets six of these P-cores, so 12 threads from here. The ""Gracemont"" E-cores are architecturally unchanged from ""Alder Lake,"" but are tuned with higher frequencies, and the most important hardware-level change is the L2 cache. Groups of four E-cores are organized as E-core clusters, which share an L2 cache among the cores. Intel doubled this cache size from 2 MB on ""Alder Lake"" to 4 MB. Much like the P-cores, Intel has updated the L2 cache prefetcher algorithm for E-core clusters. The ""Raptor Lake"" silicon physically features four E-core clusters, so 16 E-cores in total. The Core i7-14700K is carved out by disabling one of these clusters, giving you 12 E-cores; while the i5-14600K is designed by disabling two E-core clusters, as well as two P-cores, for its 6P+8E configuration. Intel made several other updates to the cache and memory sub-system from Alder Lake, besides the enlarged L2 caches mentioned above. The shared L3 cache is now as large as 36 MB of the Core i9 SKUs, 33 MB for the Core i7 SKUs, and 24 MB for the Core i5 K/KF SKUs. The Ring Bus interconnect continues to be the town-square for this silicon, and Intel has increased its frequency by 900 MHz, now at up to 5.00 GHz (it ran at up to 4.10 GHz on the i9-12900K). The new Dynamic INI (inclusive/non-inclusive) architecture lets components reserve portions of the L3 cache to themselves to minimize cache misses or DRAM roundtrips if the cache is saturated. The processor supports dual-channel DDR5 and DDR4 memory types (2x 64-bit channels in case of DDR4, 4x 32-bit sub-channels in case of DDR5). The chip supports DDR5-5600 natively (JEDEC spec), while the native DDR4 frequency is unchanged at DDR4-3200. While it didn't put out detailed architectural block-diagrams of its CPU cores like it did the last time, Intel was kind enough to give us a breakdown of how it achieved its claimed 15% single-threaded performance uplift, and >40% multi-threaded uplift. Generational increases to frequency, cache size and prefetcher improvements, and and memory frequency uplifts, add to these. Multi-threaded performance uplift rides on the back of these; plus the doubling in E-core count. Contributing to not just multi-threaded performance, but also consistency in multi-threaded performance across applications, are a series of updates to Intel Thread Director, the hardware-level middleware that makes Intel's Hybrid architecture work with software, by directing the right kind of workload to the right kind of CPU cores. It collaborates with OS scheduler improvements of Windows 11 22H2, particularly with smarter QoS (performance outlay) for background tasks. Intel Z790 Chipset Intel did not introduce any new chipset with the 14th Gen Core family, these processors are supported across 600-series and 700-series chipset motherboards, which may require a UEFI firmware update. Nearly all motherboard vendors have new motherboard models with out of the box support for the new chips, and it stands to reason that the latest batches of their older motherboard models will include this support. Alongside the six 13th Gen K-series processors SKUs, Intel is debuting the Z790 chipset. Motherboards based on this are guaranteed to come with out-of-the-box support for 13th Gen processors, even though 600-series chipset motherboards support them via a BIOS update, and many premium models feature USB BIOS Flashback. The Z790 sees a rebalancing of the downstream PCIe connectivity in favor of more downstream Gen 4 PCIe lanes, compared to the previous-gen Z690. You will find Z790 motherboards with DDR5 memory support, as well as those with DDR4 support—Intel hasn't restricted motherboard vendors from doing so. Unboxing and Photography The Core i7-14700K processor package looks just like other 14th gen, 13th gen and 12th Gen processors, as it shares the same LGA1700 socket. It's backwards-compatible with 600-series chipset motherboards with a BIOS update. Intel Socket LGA1700 has an intuitive installation process that should be familiar from many past LGA sockets. Trouble is that it comes with a different cooler mount-hole spacing than LGA1200 and the five different Socket-H series sockets before it, so you'll need to search for a compatible cooler, which should be no problem, since LGA1700 has been on the market for several years now. Test Setup All applications, games, and processors are tested with the drivers and hardware listed below—no performance results were recycled between test systems. All games and applications are tested using the same version. All games are set to their highest quality setting unless indicated otherwise.

AIDA64 comes with a great benchmark that provides a nice overview of all these performance characteristics. Super Pi SuperPi is one of the most popular benchmarks with overclockers and tweakers. It has been used in world-record competitions practically forever. It is a purely single-threaded CPU test that calculates Pi to a large number of digits—32 million for our testing. Released in 1995, it only supports x86 floating-point instructions and thus makes for a good test for single-threaded legacy application performance. Y-Cruncher Y-Cruncher is a highly optimized piece of software that can calculate Pi and other constants to a huge number of digits. It is fully multi-threaded, uses a modern code design and is optimized for all major processor architectures. This ability has made it a popular application, used by the enthusiast community to determine and compare how powerful their overclocked systems are. Chess Simulation Creating a worthwhile opponent for the game of chess has been one of the most fascinating tasks for computer programmers for decades. In this test we're using the highly popular Stockfish chess engine to calculate optimal moves in a chess scenario. Rendering — Cinebench Cinebench is one of the most popular modern CPU benchmarks because it is built around the renderer of Maxon's Cinema 4D software. Both AMD and Intel have been showing this performance test at various public events, making it almost an industry standard. Using Cinebench R23, we test both single-threaded and multi-threaded performance. Rendering — Blender Blender is one of the few professional-grade rendering programs out there that is both free and open source. That fact alone helped build a strong community around the software, making it a highly popular benchmark program due to its ease of use as well. For our testing, we're using the Blender ""BMW 27"" benchmark scene with Blender 3.2. Rendering — Corona Corona Renderer is a modern photorealistic renderer that's available for Autodesk 3ds Max and Cinema 4D. It delivers physically plausible and predictable output due to its realistic lighting algorithm, global illumination, and beautiful materials. Corona does not support GPU rendering, so CPU performance is very important for all its users. We do not use the horribly outdated Corona Benchmark tool, which doesn't support new architectures, instead using the latest version, 8.2. Rendering — KeyShot The standalone KeyShot rendering software features fast and efficient workflows that help you get realistic high-quality product shots in the shortest possible time frame. Real-time ray tracing, multi-core photon mapping, adaptive material sampling, and a dynamic lighting core provide high-quality images that update instantly even when interactively working on the scene. KeyShot 11 is optimized for usage on both CPUs and GPUs. We use the CPU renderer because the GPU renderer still has some limitations in terms of rendering capability. Rendering — V-Ray V-Ray is a world-leading 3D rendering software that uses global illumination, path tracing, photon mapping, and irradiance maps to achieve super-realistic render output. It has been used for CG in countless motion pictures and television series. V-Ray supports all major 3D applications, which makes it a great fit for any rendering pipeline. In this test, we're using the V-Ray 5 benchmark tool in CPU-only mode to get the number of ""vsamples"" that can be processed on a given hardware. Higher is better. Game Development — Unreal Engine 5 Unreal Engine 5 is the leading multi-platform game engine in the industry. Not only advanced, it also has lots of features to help you get results quicker than with competing products—time is money. The latest version 5 adds several new features that make the engine not only suitable for gaming, but also for architecture, automotive and movie production. Before a game is shipped, there is a lengthy process called ""build, cook and package"", which optimizes the various assets, compiling and compressing them into versions that will work best on the target platform, before packaging them into optimized bundles ready for distribution. We use a relatively simple scene—usually this process takes several hours. Software Development — Visual Studio C++ Microsoft Visual C++ is probably the most popular programming language for creating professional Windows applications. It's part of Microsoft's Visual Studio development suite, which has a long history and is widely accepted as the gold standard when it comes to IDEs. Compiling software is a relatively lengthy process that turns program code into the final executable, and programmers hate waiting for it to complete. We run a medium-sized application through the Visual Studio 2022 C++ compiler and linker, and use the resource compiler, too. The build is executed in ""release"" mode with all optimizations turned on and multi-processor compilation enabled. Web Browsing — JetStream 2 The JetStream 2 browser benchmark combines multiple JavaScript and WebAssembly benchmarks with several advanced workloads to determine how quickly a browser can complete specific tasks. It not only rewards high overall performance, but also fast startup and consistent operation. Web Browsing — Speedometer 2 Speedometer 2 tests a ""to-do list"" web application that's implemented using a huge number of popular frameworks. Among the benchmarks are versions built with React, Ember.js, AngularJS, vue.js, jQuery and others—frameworks that are used by the most popular sites in the world. Web Browsing — WebXPRT WebXPRT 4 is a browser benchmark that measures the performance of typical web applications, like photo enhancement, media management using AI, stock option pricing, encryption, OCR, charting, and productivity. It contains HTML5, JavaScript, and WebAssembly-based scenarios to mirror typical every day workloads. Machine Learning — Image Upscaling Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have enabled us to create applications that are almost magical in their abilities. In our first AI benchmark, we use Topaz Gigapixel AI to upscale a series of low resolution photos to higher resolution, while improving fine details at the same time. Machine Learning — Image Classification Teaching an AI to accurately recognize the contents of an image has always been one of the holy grails of Machine Learning research. Nero AI Photo Tagger is a consumer-oriented application that implements a simple way to use these algorithms. We let the software classify 5000 photos with tags like ""car,"" ""dog,"" or ""flower."" Machine Learning — Tensorflow Building an AI to solve complex problems first requires it to be trained through a large training data set that is evaluated repeatedly to generate a neural network that can later be put to work (also called inference). Google's Python-based Tensorflow is one of the most popular machine-learning software packages that supports both CPUs and GPUs. Setting up Tensorflow for the GPU is complicated, so lots of algorithm development and training on small data sets still happens on the CPU. Training performance on the CPU can also beat the GPU when problem sizes exceed typical GPU memory capacities. Physics Simulation COMSOL is the gold standard for the accurate simulation of physics effects and one of the strongest competitors to Ansys. Where the software shines is in solving multiphysics problems that depend on several phenomena—you can simulate everything, including black holes. The modular aspect of COMSOL helps professionals customize the software to their desires, which can be run with a single module or a whole multitude of collaborating modules for more demanding tasks, as well as with two-way communication with external programs, such as CAD software. Chemistry Simulation NAMD is developed by the University of Illinois and helps researchers simulate the dynamic interactions between molecules and atoms. It is an established means of molecular dynamics simulation that scales from individual clusters of molecules to full-on chemical interaction in different phases. Parallel simulation modes help differentiate NAMD from its peers, allowing efficient problem solving of larger systems using the Charm++ parallel programming model as the base. Medical Science — Genome Analysis COVID-19 has shown the world that deadly pandemics can bring society to a standstill. Computational genomics is essential for rapid development of vaccine candidates in a race against time. In this test we're running an analysis on a set of genomes to determine which individuals in the dataset share common traits in their DNA. This is not only a compute-intensive workload, but it also uses quite a lot of memory (over 10 GB), which makes it dependent on the performance of the memory subsystem. Microsoft Office Microsoft's Office suite needs no introduction as it's probably the most widely used PC software on the planet, installed on every office computer no matter the industry. Our tests cover a wide range of editing and creation tasks in Word, PowerPoint, Excel and Outlook. Image Editing — Adobe Photoshop Adobe Photoshop has become the industry standard for photo and image processing. We run the latest Photoshop CC through a battery of typical editing tasks, like image resize, various blurs, sharpening, color and light adjustments, and image export. We also apply more complex actions like content-aware fill, lens correction, smart sharpen, select subject, and tilt shift. Video Editing — Adobe Premiere Pro Adobe Premiere Pro CC is the workhorse of the video production industry for creating high-quality content for film, TV, and the web. It can handle pretty much every recorded file format and supports workflows for editing Full HD, 4K, 8K, and virtual reality content. Unfortunately, most of Premiere Pro is single-threaded, and media encoding is highly GPU accelerated, so benchmarking ""export"" on the CPU makes little sense. For our testing, we're using the software's ""object tracking"" functionality, which automatically scans through a video to follow a specific person or object—this task does indeed use more than a single core, but doesn't fully scale. A lot of memory is consumed and accessed in the process, over 10 GB for our test scene. Video Production — Adobe After Effects While Premiere Pro is optimized for cutting, arranging and editing videos, Adobe After Effects is the industry standard for creating motion graphics, text rendering, color correction and other visual effects like outlines, explosions etc. When applied, each of these takes up a little bit of CPU time, so when there's many of them, processing duration will increase quite a bit. We're measuring the time it takes to export a short intro trailer, including music and sound. Create 3D Model from Photos Creating 3D models is a tedious and complex task that takes time and requires experienced artists. It's thus the holy grail of 3D modeling to reconstruct a 3D model from just a series of photos. That's exactly what Photogrammetry does. This method is also used to reconstruct terrain geometry from photos taken by aerial drones. Antivirus Scan Securing your system against viruses and malware is essential for reliable operation. Antivirus software detects unwanted programs by comparing files to a large database with thousands of signatures and rules. In this test we're measuring how long it takes to scan all files of a 30 GB game. Altium PCB Designer Altium Designer has been used to make at least one of the circuit boards inside your favorite piece of electronics. It's an industry-leading solution to build complex PCBs by automating circuit paths and ensuring that signal integrity and design rules are followed in the design. Our test measures how long it takes for Altium PCB Designer to load a project, run various operations on it, including autorouting, design rule check and finally releasing the whole design to manufacturing. Text Recognition OCR — Google Tesseract Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is the task of turning text in scanned images or photos into actual characters for archival, further processing, or editing. While most OCR software is single-threaded, Google's Tesseract engine can operate on multiple pages of a scanned document at once, spreading the load over several processor cores. The software, which is considered one of the most accurate open-source OCR packages available, automatically runs a spellcheck on the initial recognition results, which adds to the complexity of the workload. Virtualization — Oracle VirtualBox A virtual machine is a simulated computer inside your computer that's completely independent of the host PC. This not only improves security, but also enables software written for different operating systems to execute on one physical machine. Virtualization is the foundation for ""the cloud"" and helps reduce hardware ownership cost by dynamically spreading out virtual machines over multiple computers to make the best use of available hardware resources. We're testing VM performance using Oracle's VM VirtualBox software, with hardware virtualization support enabled for both Intel and AMD processors. Curiously, many motherboards ship with the virtualization setting disabled by default, so we made absolutely certain we had enabled it. Database — MySQL More data is stored and processed today than ever before in human history. Database systems that manage storage and retrieval throughout large data sets are the backbone for this revolution. Whenever you interact with a website or other digital service, one database is almost always guaranteed to be involved in returning the results you are looking for. We benchmark the most popular database system, MySQL, in the TPC-C test, which simulates a large number of warehouses and their constantly changing inventory. The reported number is ""transactions per second,"" so higher is better. Database — NoSQL While traditional relational databases are the industry standard for a lot of workloads, NoSQL databases use a different, non-tabular approach, which offers tremendous speedups for certain workloads. That's why they are used in many big data and real-time web applications today. We benchmark how long it takes MongoDB to complete 10 million requests. Java The Java programming language is designed to be platform independent, highly scalable, and fault tolerant, which is why it's very popular for enterprise services that work with large amounts of data and many concurrent users. Our test suite consists of a large mix of individual Java benchmarks, some of them single-threaded, some that scale somewhat, and some that fully scale to as many cores as are available. Web Hosting People don't like excessive load times in their browser, which makes handling all the incoming requests of a busy website in a timely manner a non-trivial task that can potentially overload some server systems. In our web server benchmark we're recording how long it takes an ASP.NET Core 6.0 based content management system to process a million requests to its ""about us"" page. Our benchmark uses an in-memory mock database to not be bottlenecked by the backing database engine. Compression — WinRAR Data is compressed almost all the time when it moves over the wire to reduce download time and transfer sizes. WinRAR uses a more advanced compression algorithm than classic ZIP, which is why we chose it for this test. It's also able to scale across multiple processor cores. Compression — 7-Zip Another popular compression software is 7-Zip, which includes a benchmark that measures the integer instruction rate (MIPS) using the ZIP algorithm. It makes good use of multiple threads, when available. Encryption — AES Encryption is the foundation for secure communication on the internet. The AES encryption standard is one of the most popular encryption algorithm these days because of its simplicity and resistance to attacks. Unlike other encryption methods, AES is symmetric, which means the same key is used for encrypting and decrypting data. Being able to quickly encrypt and decrypt information is important, which is the reason why modern processors have an instruction set extension called ""AES-NI"" that accelerates these operations. Encryption — SHA3 ""SHA"" is technically not encryption, but hashing. A cryptographic hash function is a mathematical algorithm that creates a fingerprint value for existing data. This is a one-way function, which is practically impossible to invert. Another requirement for a good hashing algorithm is that you can't create a collision: craft a message that yields a specific hash value. The SHA3 algorithm achieves all that and is also often used to authenticate transmitted data which possibly was encrypted with AES first. Sony PS3 Emulator RPCS3 is a popular PlayStation 3 emulator for PCs, which let you play many Sony PS3 titles on your favorite platform. The emulator has serious hardware requirements, and some of its emulation threads constantly need to communicate with each other, which makes it a tough workload for many CPU architectures. RPCS3 also benefits from faster cache and memory speeds, when available. AVX-512 is enabled where supported, including Zen 4. Nintendo Switch Emulator Ryujinx is a highly compatible, feature-rich emulator for the Nintendo Switch console. It relies heavily on your CPU, and also comes with some tricks how to use the memory management unit (MMU) of your processor to handle the emulated environment. While it is multi-threaded, higher single-core performance is more important than being able to scale to many cores. Media Encoding — AV1 Nowadays, all video that is consumed, whether on TV, physical media, or streamed over the internet, is compressed using various codecs. AV1 is a next-generation video codec that is open and royalty-free, unlike other recent new video compression algorithms. Major industry players like YouTube, Netflix, and Facebook stand behind AV1 and are gradually rolling out support for the new format. Compared to older algorithms, such as H.264, the compression rate is much better, or you can achieve higher image quality for a given bitrate. We use the SVT-AV1 encoder with a 4K video source to compress to AV1. Media Encoding — H.265 / HEVC Our second video-encoding test uses the H.265 codec, which is also known as HEVC. We compress a 4K video using the latest version of the X265 encoder with 8-bit color depth, preset ""slow,"" and a quality setting of crf 20. Media Encoding — H.264 / AVC H.264, also called AVC, is a slightly older compression format, though probably the most widely used these days because it is well supported, even on older hardware. We compress the same video as in the H.265 test using the X264 encoding software, with the preset ""slower"" and crf 20. Media Encoding — MP3 MP3 revolutionized the music industry like no other technology. Introduced in the 90s, it enabled a massive reduction in audio-file sizes, without noticeable impact on sound quality. This made music downloads, and ultimately streaming, a feasible method of content delivery over the Internet. For our benchmark, we convert a 2.5 hour-long 44.1 kHz Stereo recording to a variable bitrate MP3 file. MP3 encoding is a single-threaded process. Game Tests: 720p On popular demand from comments over the past several CPU reviews, we are including game tests at 720p (1280x720 pixels) resolution. All games from our CPU test suite are put through 720p using a RTX 4090 graphics card and Ultra settings. This low resolution serves to highlight theoretical CPU performance, because games are extremely CPU-limited at this resolution. Of course, nobody buys a PC with an RTX 4090 to game at 720p, but the results are of academic value because a CPU that can't do 144 frames per second at 720p will never reach that mark at higher resolutions. So, these numbers could interest high-refresh-rate gaming PC builders with fast monitors. Our 720p tests hence serve as synthetic tests in that they are not real world (720p isn't a real-world PC-gaming resolution anymore) even though the game tests themselves are not synthetic (they're real games, not 3D benchmarks). Individual Benchmark Scores Gaming with Ray Tracing Game Tests 1080p Individual Benchmark Scores Gaming with Ray Tracing Game Tests 1440p Individual Benchmark Scores Gaming with Ray Tracing Game Tests 4K Individual Benchmark Scores Gaming with Ray Tracing Minimum FPS While average FPS is the most useful metric to tell you the typical experience during gameplay, minimum FPS will tell you what's happening in worst-cases, like during intense battles or other demanding situations. All results on this page report the 1% Low FPS, or 99th percentile. Per definition these results are based on a smaller set of data for each benchmark run, which makes the numbers more unpredictable, so the uncertainties are higher than in our normal average FPS data. You may look at all the individual test runs by clicking the button at the end of the page. Individual Benchmark Scores Show Per-Game Results Application Power Consumption All power measurements on this page are based on a physical measurement of the voltage, current and power flowing through the 8-pin EPS CPU power connector(s), which makes them ""CPU only,"" not ""full system."" We're not using the software sensors inside the processor, as these can be quite inaccurate and will vary between manufacturers. All measurements are collected and processed at a rate of 30 data points per second, on a separate machine, so the power measurement does not affect the tested system in any way. Our new data processing pipeline allows us to link recorded data precisely with benchmark runs, so we can easily create the charts below. Gaming Power Consumption Energy Efficiency Just looking at power draw in watts won't paint the whole picture for any given processor. It's not only important how much power is consumed, but also how quickly a task is completed—taking both into account results in ""efficiency."" Since a faster processor will complete a given workload quicker, the total amount of energy used might end up less than on a low-powered processor, which might draw less power, but will take longer to finish the test. In this section, we divide the performance achieved by the power usage, to get a Cinebench points per watt single-threaded and multi-threaded result. For gaming (with GeForce RTX 4090) we divide the average FPS of all our games by the power consumed, for a frames per watt rating. All these tests are based on our CPU-only power measurements, not whole system. Power Draw: Core i7-14700K vs Ryzen 7 7800X3D Power Draw: Core i7-14700K vs Ryzen 9 7900 Power Draw: Core i7-14700K vs Ryzen 9 7900X Power Draw: Core i7-14700K vs Core i7-13700K Temperatures We're using a Noctua NH-U14S for temperature measurements. Application temperatures are measured using Blender, a highly demanding rendering load, which will load all cores completely, but that's still realistic and not a synthetic stress test, like Prime95. For gaming, we picked Cyberpunk 2077, its modern engine is multi-thread aware and will try to spread as many tasks as possible over a large number of CPU cores, when available. Even when a game uses multiple threads it doesn't load each CPU core as heavily as rendering, for example, so there's some scope for power savings here. Note that unless indicated otherwise, all processors are tested at stock conditions with their power limit active, which is why some Intel temperatures are surprisingly low. As designed by Intel, these CPUs can exceed its TDP for a few seconds (PL2), but in the long term, the power limit (PL1) is respected, which brings down temperatures considerably. Both tests report the steady-state temperature after an extended runtime of at least 10 minutes. Temperatures are based on delta T, normalized to 25°C, that's why the temperature of some CPUs is higher than their throttle point, because the room temperature was below 25°C. For the new Intel CPUs we've increased the temperature limit in BIOS from 100°C to 115°C, to get a better feel for temperatures without thermal throttle getting in the way. We also did a round of testing with the Noctua D15 to get a feel for temps with a more powerful cooler (indicated by ""D15"" in the charts). Clock Frequencies The following chart shows how well the processor sustains its clock frequency and which boost clock speeds are achieved at various thread counts. This test uses a custom-coded application that mimics real-life performance—it is not a stress test like Prime95. Modern processors change their clocking behavior depending on the type of load, which is why we provide three plots with classic floating point math, SSE SIMD code, and modern AVX vector instructions. Each of the three test runs calculates the same result using the same algorithm, just with a different CPU instruction set. The E-Core side of this chart (threads 17 to 28) can be somewhat misleading. It looks like the cores run at increasingly slower frequencies as the load goes up, but that's not the case. The frequency plotted is the average of all the P-Cores active, plus more and more E-Cores, which all run at a lower frequency than the P-Cores, which drags down the average. That's why I tested E-Core frequency scaling separately in the chart below. Overclocking Overclocking the Core i7-14700K is easy, thanks to its unlocked multiplier. The biggest problem is the heat though, even at stock you'll be close to 100°C and higher. Overclocking the 14700K means setting the thermal limit to 115°C up from 100°C, and then figuring out what's the highest voltage you can give the CPU without hitting throttling at 115°C, depending on your cooling solution. In my case that was just 0.08 V, which limits the frequency increases. Switching from air to our Arctic AIO helped with controlling the heat, but it wasn't a huge difference. Our maximum all-core OC is 5.5 GHz on the P-Cores, plus 4.4 GHz on the E-Cores, 100% stable, which isn't a significant improvement over the stock configuration. Performance Summary Performance per Dollar Value and Conclusion The Intel Core i7-14700K is priced at $410 according to Intel. Four additional E-Cores Reasonably priced Gaming performance very close to Core i9 Faster than Ryzen 9 7900X in applications Better game performance than all non-X3D Ryzens Support for PCI-Express 5.0 Multiplier unlocked Integrated graphics Compatible with 600 and 700 Series chipset motherboards Support for DDR4 & DDR5 memory Only minor improvements over 13th Gen Very high power usage Ryzen 7800X3D is faster in gaming Demanding cooling requirements / high temperatures Highest boost on two cores only Only PCIe x8 graphics when Gen 5 M.2 slot in-use No support for AI Assist / APO CPU cooler not included No support for AVX512 Today we're allowed to publish our performance results for Intel's new Raptor Lake Refresh processors. For our launch coverage we've posted reviews of all three new models released today: Core i9-14900K , Core i7-14700K and Core i5-14600K . This year's Intel Core processor launch looks like it'll be the last one with the ""Core i"" branding. The company's next-generation Meteor Lake CPUs will use an updated naming scheme, and will just be called ""Core"" and ""Core Ultra."" Under the hood, 14th Gen uses the same Raptor Lake dies that we've seen in 13th Generation CPUs, with some improvements. During their briefings Intel confirmed that they have ""optimized the design and process technology,"" but also that the same manufacturing node, core design, IPC and Thread Director capability is used. All the SKUs released today are based on a single die and revision (unlike 13th Gen). There are some new features like XTU AI Assist and Intel Application Optimization, more on those later. While the other 14th Gen models only received clock frequency bumps, the Core i9-14700K actually comes with an improved core count configuration. While the 13700K features eight P-Cores and eight E-Cores with a total thread count of 24, the 14700K comes with an additional cluster of E-Cores, bringing the core count to 8+12, enabling a thread count of 28. On top of that you're getting higher clock speeds. We measured the 14700K to boost to 5.6 GHz with two or less cores active, and 5.5 GHz with three cores or more. This is a 200 MHz increase over the 13700K, which reached 5.4/5.3 GHz in the same test. Just to confirm, these are our own measurements of the actual CPU, not just an extract from Intel's specs list. Since it has more cores, the 14700K also has a slightly bigger cache of 33 MB, vs 30 MB on the 13700K. Averaged over the 45 tests in our application test suite, the Core i7-14700K clearly beats the 13700K, with a gap or around 5.6%, which is not a lot, but more than what we've seen on the other SKUs released today. This performance increase helps the CPU to make up ground to the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, which is now only 3.5% faster. The 13900K is only 5.7% quicker—close enough, especially when you consider the price difference. Intel's new flagship, the 14900K is 8.7% ahead, but 44% more expensive. AMD's various Ryzen 7 models really can't touch the 14700K when it comes to applications, they are considerably slower (7700X: -25%, 7700: -30%). The Ryzen 7 7800X3D is a lean gaming machine, but in applications it's pretty far behind, by 28%. With these performance numbers there is little reason to consider an upgrade if you're on a modern 12th or 13th Gen processor, but it'll be an interesting option for owners of older machines. Gaming on the Core i7-14700K works extremely well and is pretty much indistinguishable from the Core i9-14900K when not looking at FPS counters. We measured only a tiny 3% difference, 1% at 4K. What makes the 14700K a great choice for gaming is that it has the most P-Cores possible, eight, just like the 14900K. Compared to AMD's offerings, the 14700K is able to beat every single Ryzen processor out there, with the exception of the X3D models. A recent poll on TPU has shown that a lot of gamers are betting on AMD's 3D Vertical Cache Technology, and rightfully so. While the 7950X3D trades higher application performance for some compatibility issues in games, the 7800X3D is a pure gaming monster that tops our FPS charts. It consistently beats the 14700K on average at all our four tested resolutions, but at $400 it's only marginally cheaper than the $410 14700K. Overall it's important to realize that these performance differences are not that big, especially in subjective gameplay. All Intel 14th Gen, 13th Gen with large cache, and 12900K, 12700K, other Zen 4 CPUs and more will give you an outstanding gaming experience. We've seen very high power consumption numbers in today's Core i9-14900K review, the Core i7-14700K isn't much different. In applications it uses 155 W vs 170 W on the i9. Gaming power draw is similarly high with 132 W vs 144 W on the i9. Both processors have virtually the same core configuration: 8+16 and 8+12. Four E-Cores aren't going to make a big difference. Just like the 14900K, the 14700K runs at PL1 = PL2 = 253 W. What's making most of the difference is that the 14900K is clocked a good deal higher, which increases its power consumption. AMD's energy efficiency is much better. The 7900X is just 86 W in applications, and the 7800X3D is only 49 W in gaming—a third (!) of the 14700K. While I don't think the power cost difference will be a dealbreaker (75 W @ 4 hours per day @ 30 cents/kWh = $33 per year), the added heat dumped into the case and eventually into your gaming cave might make you reconsider. Cooling such high heat output isn't easy on the CPU cooler either. You'll be hitting 100°C very quickly, which will regularly result in thermal throttling with most air coolers. This is not a huge deal, as modern processors are very good at keeping a certain target temperature by slightly reducing clocks, without performance falling off a cliff—it's still not what you've spent all that money for. A watercooling solution will help, just like increasing the temperature limit, which goes up to 115°C. You could also undervolt the CPU or dial the power limit back. Things aren't that much better on the Zen 4 side though, because AMD wanted to keep cooler compatibility with Socket AM4, so they had to install an extra thick heat spreader on the AM5 CPUs, which make them difficult to cool, too, but it's easier due to the lower overall heat output. Although the unlocked multiplier makes overclocking technically easy, it is limited by the cooling system. Even when the thermal limit is raised from 100°C to the maximum of 115°C, it is difficult to push voltage much further, even with an AIO. At least Intel is giving us the option to adjust the temperature limit, AMD has no such feature. My highest all-core OC was 5.5 GHz, which is gains a tiny bit performance over stock, but pushes power consumption up quite a bit. Not worth it. On the Core i9-14900K we saw pretty decent results from Intel's AI Assist overclocking option in the XTU overclocking utility. At launch, this option is only available on the 14900K, Intel confirmed that they are looking into adding support for the other 14th Gen SKUs, too. AI Assist works surprisingly well, it takes less than a minute to run and will provide you with a good starting point that goes beyond just a fixed multiplier on all cores like we're doing in our OC testing. It's a shame that it doesn't work on the other models, but I understand the problem Intel is facing. AI Assist could also do with more love, right now saving the recommendations to BIOS isn't possible, so you'll have to reapply them with XTU on every restart, or manually copy them into your BIOS. A major issue is that XTU does not work with Windows VBS enabled, which is the default on all new OS installations. Still, it's good to see that Intel is making improvements for overclockers. On the other hand, I wish they gave us more manual controls with better BIOS integration, like AMD does. Intel's biggest ""new tech"" announcement is their Intel Application Optimization technology, or just ""APO."" The promise is that Intel will release hand-optimized profiles for specific games to control the thread count and thread type in real-time, which goes beyond what Thread Director offers. Unfortunately Intel was unable to provide reviewers with access to APO, so we couldn't test the technology to verify Intel's claims. Intel did confirm that APO works only on two older games at this time, which is a surprisingly small number of titles for a new release, especially coming from a resourceful company like Intel. Intel has announced an MSRP of $410 for the Core i7-14700K, which matches the current pricing of 13700K. If both processors are priced the same there is no reason to buy the 13700K over the 14700K. I'd even spend another $30-$40 for the additional four E-Cores, the extra cache and the frequency bump. AMD really doesn't have much to compete with the 14700K for applications. The Ryzen 9 7900 ($410) and 7900X ($450) are slower in applications, maybe relevant if power usage matters to you. Ryzen 9 7950X is too expensive at $590, just like 7950X3D ($685). While I would not pick the $400 7800X3D for a mostly-applications scenario, its capabilities as a gaming CPU definitely put it on the list. Price-wise both processors are evenly matched with just $10 separating them. While the 7800X3D offers better gaming performance, the 14700K wins in applications. As pure gamer I'd probably lean toward the 7800X3D, also because of its power efficiency, which helps keep case and room temperatures down. Once productivity comes into that mix, I'd probably pick the Intel CPU, but the differences will be small, especially subjectively. At this time it looks like Meteor Lake isn't coming to the desktop space, mostly because it tops out at just six P-Cores, so Intel needed something they could sell this holiday season, which explains why 14th Gen is released as Raptor Lake Refresh. I think Meteor Lake could be an amazing release for entry-level and midrange PCs, which is where most of the sales are anyway. The next desktop release for Intel seems to be Arrow Lake, with core counts reaching 8+16, but that's scheduled not before 2024, possibly even later. AMD's Zen 5 is expected to release next year, but we don't know about the improvements yet, I'd still expect that AMD will defend the gaming crown for the foreseeable future. Performance isn't everything though, and if Intel adjusts their pricing, they could spoil AMD's party. It seems likely that we'll be seeing price cuts on 13th Gen processors, which could make them an attractive choice for people who know what they are buying, without looking at model numbers.

3,Ryzen 7 7700x,"Introduction AMD's next-generation Ryzen ""Zen 4"" is here and we have the reviews! The new Ryzen 7 7700X is designed for high-performance gaming PC builds, letting you play at any resolution and with any game settings, when paired with a fast graphics card. It comes with the latest connectivity, including DDR5 memory and PCI-Express Gen 5, and a brand-new platform built around the new Socket AM5 LGA. The new ""Zen 4"" core aims to deliver a 13% IPC uplift over ""Zen 3,"" while the much higher clock speeds enabled with this generation amount to a 29% single-threaded performance uplift in total over the previous-generation. With these, AMD claims to have stormed to the top, beating Intel's 12th Gen Core ""Alder Lake."" This Ryzen 7 7700X review covers the 8-core/16-thread processor at its $400 price-point, which compares to Intel's Core i7-12700K (8P+4E). AMD is unfazed with Intel's Hybrid architecture, E-cores, believing its processors can overcome the core-count deficit and beat Intel's offerings. The homogeneous core design localized to a single CCD also ensures the highest possible performance with less-parallelized applications, such as games and content-creation tools that don't need too many cores. AMD is also the first to offer CPU-attached PCIe Gen 5 NVMe that doesn't eat into the PEG lanes. Increases in the PCIe lane budget means motherboard designers can now opt for up to two CPU-attached Gen 5 NVMe, besides up to three chipset-attached Gen 4. The ""Zen 4"" architecture is designed to make most of the added bandwidth that DDR5 memory brings to the table, and to ensure support of PCIe Gen 5 devices such as next-generation SSDs and graphics cards. Besides the latest connectivity, it also introduces support for AVX-512 and VNNI, making it capable of accelerated AI inferencing, bringing it on par with Intel in this area. AMD has increased the L2 cache size, so the total cache (L2+L3) is now up to 40 MB, from 36 MB on the previous-gen 5700X. Ryzen 7 7700X, as we mentioned, is an 8-core/16-thread processor. It comes with clock speeds of 4.50 GHz base, and 5.40 GHz boost. Each of its eight cores features a 1 MB dedicated L2 cache, and access to the 32 MB of shared L3 cache. The processor puts out 28 lanes of PCIe Gen 5 (compared to 16 Gen 5 and 12 Gen 4 lanes from ""Alder Lake""), and comes with a DDR5-only memory interface (no backwards-compatibility with DDR4, unlike Alder Lake). AMD has also added integrated graphics across the lineup. This levels the playing field with Intel, as now all the non-gaming productivity users who chose Intel for their integrated graphics, can pick a competing AMD processor without having to wait for APUs with large iGPUs. In this review, we take the Ryzen 7 7700X for a ride to find out how it measures up to Intel. We have rebenched every processor before this review with the latest selection of benchmarks and game-tests, and up-to-date software; additionally we've used a vast selection of processors, dating all the way back to several years ago, so you know if it's time to upgrade. The Zen 4 Platform AMD Zen has been one of the most remarkable turnarounds for a company in the semiconductor industry, and has had a profound impact on the consumer, as it influenced Intel's CPU core-counts. With each new generation of Zen, AMD delivered IPC and overall performance improvements, and Zen 4 stands out as it not only aims to improve performance, but also introduce a brand-new platform, after five years of Socket AM4. As a parting gift, AMD enabled official Zen 3 support on even the oldest 300-series chipset, which goes to show just how consumer-friendly AM4 was, and the company hopes to repeat this with AM5. The new AM5 socket is needed as the company enables the latest I/O, including DDR5 memory and PCI-Express Gen 5, besides power-delivery improvements. The socket can now deliver up to 230 W of power, giving AMD room to increase CPU core-counts in the future. AM5 is a land-grid array, just like Intel desktop sockets, but the company somehow retained CPU cooler compatibility with AM4. Zen 4 Chip Configuration The Ryzen 7000 series desktop processor, codenamed ""Raphael,"" is a multi-chip module, just like Ryzen 5000 ""Vermeer"" and Ryzen 3000 ""Matisse."" The CPU cores are located in specialized dies called CCDs (CPU complex dies), while the platform I/O control is located in a separate die called cIOD (client I/O die). The CCDs were fabricated on the latest TSMC 5 nm EUV (N5) node, while the cIOD use the TSMC 6 nm (N6) node. The idea here is that the parts that benefit the most from the switch to the latest foundry process—the CPU cores—are built on this node; while everything else that can do with a slightly older node, is done so. This way AMD can make the most of its 5 nm foundry allocation with TSMC. The MCM contains a cIOD, and two 8-core CCDs in case of the Ryzen 9 7950X and 7900X; or one 8-core CCD in case of the Ryzen 7 7700X and Ryzen 5 7600X. The Infinity Fabric interconnect handles communications not just within these dies, but also between them. The transition to fast DDR5 memory and PCIe Gen 5 means that AMD now can push instructions and data around faster. AMD did so with microarchitectural improvements to the ""Zen 4"" core itself, while also increasing the Infinity Fabric bandwidth between the cores. The Zen 4 CPU Core All cores in Ryzen 7000 series processors are of the same kind, what Intel would consider a performance-core, or P-core. AMD has worked on all three key stages of the CPU—the front-end, the execution, and the load/store. The front-end is the ""mouth"" of the CPU core, and prepares data and instructions for execution. Front-end improvements begin at the Branch Prediction unit, which can how predict 2 taken branches per clock-cycle, and comes with larger L1 and L2 branch-target buffers (BTBs). AMD had for the very first time introduced an OpCache with Zen, improving it over time. AMD has increased the size of the OpCache by around 68 percent. It can now handle 9 macro-ops per cycle. The micro-op queue dispatch rate to the execution stage is still 6. The Execution Stage is the main number-crunching machinery, and broadly features two components for the kind of math workload being executed—Integer and Floating Point. The ""Zen 4"" execution stage features a 25% larger instruction retire queue, larger register files, and higher buffer queue-depths throughout the core. With ""Zen 4,""AMD is introducing support for AVX-512, in a bid to increase the processor's AI inferencing performance. The company did this in a die-area efficient, and energy-efficient manner, with no impact on CPU core frequency. AVX-512 operations are executed on a dual-pumped 256-bit FPU, rather than building from the ground-up 512-bit FP hardware. VNNI and Bfloat16 instruction-sets are also added, which mean that ""Zen 4"" can handle pretty much all of the AVX-512 client-relevant workloads that competing Intel processors can. The Load/Store unit is the part of the core that interfaces with the memory sub-system. The ""Zen 4"" core gets a 22 percent larger Load Queue, with improved data-port conflict-resolution. There's a 50% larger L2 data transition lookaside buffer. The cache-hierarchy of the Ryzen 7000 desktop processor is similar to that of Ryzen 5000, with a few key differences, besides bandwidth/latency improvements—the dedicated L2 cache has been doubled in size to 1 MB. The eight CPU cores on a CCD share a monolithic 32 MB L3 cache, with uniform access to each core. These improvements contribute to a 13 percent IPC improvement over ""Zen 3,"" AMD claims. The company provided a break-up of which components are contributing to the IPC uplift, and we see that close to two-thirds of it are coming from improvements to the front-end and load/store stages. Branch prediction improvements contribute a fifth of this uplift. Interestingly, the L2 cache contributes barely 1/10th of the IPC uplift, in the tested applications—we believe this increase is mostly relevant for server applications where it should be able to make more of a difference. Intel's ""Golden Cove"" P-core comes with 1.25 MB L2 cache, and the upcoming ""Raptor Cove"" is expected to feature 2 MB. Despite the doubling in L2 cache sizes, the resulting increase in cache latency is very well contained (from 12 cycles on the 512 KB L2 of ""Zen 3,"" to just 14 cycles on ""Zen 4""). VBS (virtualization-based security) is the standard on new Windows 11 installs and gets activated automatically, unless you specifically disable it. Windows 11 Security Center already flags VBS not being enabled as a warning, similar to Antivirus being disabled or outdated. AMD made several improvements to the Virtualization feature-set, to reduce its performance impact in a VBS-enabled client environment. This includes speculation control, dual AVIC to go with the physical dual-APIC, and TSC_AUX virtualization. New 6 nm IO Die Ryzen 3000 ""Matisse"" and Ryzen 5000 ""Vermeer"" processors featured a cIOD built on the 12 nm FinFET Global Foundries node, but with Ryzen 7000 ""Raphael"", AMD is taking a giant leap toward improving the power characteristics of the cIOD, by building it on the new 6 nm TSMC node. This was needed mainly because the cIOD now packs an RDNA 2 iGPU, besides the higher bandwidth switching fabric of the DDR5 and PCIe Gen 5 interfaces also warranting the change. The 12 nm previous-gen cIOD TDP was already estimated to draw up to 15 W, and the addition of an iGPU would've thrown things off gear. In addition to 6 nm, AMD is deploying several of the power-management features of the Ryzen 6000-series ""Rembrandt"" mobile processor on this cIOD, which mainly have to do with aggressive power management and rapid sleep/wake for the various components on the die. The new 6 nm cIOD packs a dual-channel DDR5 memory controller (4x 40-bit channels, including ECC and hardware-accelerated encryption support), with native support for DDR5-5200; a PCI-Express 5.0 x28 root-complex; a USB 3.2 controller with support for 20 Gbps 2x2 ports, USB-C, and DisplayPort passthrough from the iGPU. AMD was very clear that the inclusion of an iGPU doesn't make ""Raphael"" an APU, because the iGPU is rather basic, and just about enough for non-gaming workloads. The company intends to continue making APUs—processors with beefy iGPUs for mainstream gaming performance—including for the desktop platform. Full ECC support on desktop is technically possible, but it will depend on the motherboard manufacturers—AMD isn't doing anything to prevent them from making their boards ECC compatible. The Radeon 610 iGPU is based on the RDNA 2 graphics architecture, and packs just two Compute Units, which work out to 128 stream processors. The Display CoreNext (DCN) and Video CoreNext (VCN) components are of modern design. The VCN offers hardware-accelerated AV1 and H.265 decode, as well as hardware-accelerated H.265 encode. Just to clarify, there is hardware AV1 decode support, but no encode, which isn't a big deal at all. In terms of monitors, the DCN supports DisplayPort 2.0 UHBR10, HDMI 2.1 with FRL, and DisplayPort passthrough for the USB type-C ports connected to the on-die USB 3.2 controller. When paired with a discrete graphics card on Windows 10 or Windows 11, the iGPU supports Hybrid graphics, much in the same way as it's implemented on notebooks. You plug in your monitor to the iGPU, and it wakes up your discrete GPU (graphics card) when needed. The RDNA 2 compute units are of the same kind you'd find in Radeon RX 6000 series GPUs, including ray tracing support, but this is of no use on the Radeon 610. The only reason AMD went with RDNA 2 is because it can offer comparable levels of performance with just two CUs, to a ""Vega"" based iGPU with more CUs (thereby also increasing die-size). As we mentioned earlier, AMD needed a new socket as it was transitioning to DDR5 and PCIe Gen 5, which come with stiff physical-layer signaling requirements that AM4 couldn't provide. AM5 also makes processors ""future-ready"" as it enables two-way communication with the voltage regulators. The added pin-count was needed not just for DDR5 and its 40-bit sub-channels, but also for four additional PCIe lanes. The processor puts out a total of 28 PCIe Gen 5 lanes. 16 of these are meant for PEG (graphics card slots); 4 serve as chipset bus, and 8 lanes are available for the motherboard vendors to play around with: either wiring them both out as M.2 Gen 5 x4 slots, or wire one of them as M.2, and use the remaining 4 lanes for high-bandwidth devices, such as discrete USB4 controllers, 80 Gbps Thunderbolt 4 controllers, or even CPU-attached low-latency network interfaces. AM5 also significantly increases power-delivery capability over AM4—up to 230 W. The increased power should enable the ""Zen 4"" cores to run at very high clock-speeds approaching the 6 GHz-mark, or in the future, even enable core-count increases. The clock-domains of Ryzen 7000 are similar to those of the Ryzen 5000 series. FCLK defines the Infinity Fabric clock-speed, which is de-linked from UCLK (memory controller clock), and MCLK (DRAM clock). AMD says that DDR5-6000 strikes the ""sweetspot"" in that this is the highest MCLK you can run while retaining certain memory overclocker optimizations. On Zen 3 you'd want to run Infinity Fabric in sync with memory, but this isn't possible anymore, because FCLK can't reach 3000 MHz (assuming DDR5-6000 memory). Now the optimum config is to run FCLK at 2000, basically a 3:2 divider. Picking ""auto"" in the BIOS will automatically aim for that setting. Above 6000 MHz, the strategy will be changed to a 2:1 ratio. AMD X670E and B650E Chipsets AMD took a unique approach to chipsets with this generation. The top-tier chipset now comes in two flavors, X670E and X670. Both are identical in downstream I/O, but the X670E offers PCIe Gen 5 PEG besides CPU-attached Gen 5 NVMe; whereas the X670 only offers Gen 5 on the CPU-attached M.2 NVMe slot, but not PEG (which is Gen 4). A similar approach is taken when segregating the mid-tier B650E from the B650. The lack of Gen 5 PEG should significantly reduce motherboard costs, as designers would be saving on both Gen 5 redrivers and the steep wiring requirements to avoid signal-corruption. X670E is a 2-chip chipset unlike the previous-gen X570. This was done to increase the downstream PCIe connectivity. The chipset now offers up to 12x PCIe Gen 4 and up to 8x PCIe Gen 3 downstream lanes (not counting the lanes from the CPU). This lets motherboard designers wire out three additional M.2 Gen 4 slots attached to the chipset, while the Gen 3 lanes handle low-bandwidth onboard devices. AMD adopted a wacky way to connect the two bridges that make up the chipset. There is an ""upstream"" chipset that's wired to the AM5 SoC over a PCI-Express 4.0 x4 connection; the second bridge is called ""downstream"" chipset, and is connected to four of the PCIe Gen 4 downstream lanes of the ""upstream"" chipset. The X670/E puts out up to two 20 Gbps USB 3.2, up to eight 10 Gbps USB 3.2, and twelve USB 2.0. The B650E and B650 look like more reasonable single-chip chipsets. They talk to the SoC over PCI-Express 4.0 x4, and wire out 8x PCIe Gen 4 downstream lanes, and up to 4x PCIe Gen 3 downstream lanes. You get half the number of USB SuperSpeed ports as the X670/E. AMD EXPO Memory With Ryzen 7000 series, AMD is introducing EXPO (extended profiles for overclocking); a feature that's identical in concept to Intel XMP. AMD EXPO-certified DDR5 modules come with an easy method of applying the advertised memory speeds and timings—you simply select a toggle in the opening screen of your motherboard's UEFI BIOS program. EXPO differs from XMP in that it includes fine settings that are unique to the AMD architecture, and it's also an open standard. Until now, XMP modules installed on AMD systems relied either on painstaking manual overclocking, or use of DOCP, a feature that attempts to translate the settings in the XMP profile to ""nearest neighbors"" of AMD-compatible settings. This was sub-optimal. EXPO is royalty-free compared to XMP, so any memory manufacturer can implement it for free. Ryzen 7000 can run any PC-DDR5 memory in the market, including XMP-certified ones, so don't fret if you can't find EXPO kits just yet. Socket AM5 Here are a few pictures of Socket AM5, the star-attraction with this platform. This is a land-grid array (LGA) socket with 1,718 pins. As with every LGA socket, the pins are on the motherboard, whereas the processor package has contacts that interface with those pins, while a retention brace holds the package in place with a locking lever. Installing a processor on AM5 is similar to doing so on any of the dozens of Intel LGA sockets. On Socket AM4, removing the four mounting screws resulted in the backplate falling off, which meant you needed three hands when installing a cooler, and several vendors also bundled their own backplates. On Socket AM5 the backplate isn't designed to be removed, which makes cooler installation MUCH easier. The caps for the socket are not identical to the Intel LGA sockets, so you can't reuse them. DDR5 Memory Ryzen 7000 isn't the first consumer platform to introduce DDR5, that was done last year with Intel 12th Gen Core ""Alder Lake"". Unlike the Intel chip, Ryzen 7000 is a DDR5-only processor. So you won't come across motherboards with DDR4 slots, and will need to buy new memory. DDR5 generationally doubles the data transfer-rates over DDR4, operates at lower voltages, comes with intrinsic ECC which Ryzen 7000 supports at a silicon-level, and is optimized for parallelism, since each 80-bit memory channel contains two 40-bit sub-channels (independent paths to the memory controller). Unboxing and Photography The Ryzen 7 7700X comes in a compact paperboard box with a new look. A small cutout on the front shows the actual processor inside the package. Note that the Ryzen 7000 Series are not boxed with a cooler. The Ryzen 7000 series processor package is unlike anything we've seen, with its flower-shaped IHS design. AMD says it didn't go with a rounded-square IHS because it wanted to keep some of the electrical SMD ancillaries outside the IHS, where they're less affected by temperatures. If you flip the chip, you'll see that unlike Intel processors, there's no central ""island"" where there are no pins and instead some SMDs. The AM5 socket retention brace only applies pressure along the two side protrusions of the IHS, and when installed, the surface area for contact with the cooler is rounded-square, just like AM4 was. Test Setup All applications, games, and processors are tested with the drivers and hardware listed below—no performance results were recycled between test systems. All games and applications are tested using the same version. All games are set to their highest quality setting unless indicated otherwise.

AIDA64 comes with a great benchmark that provides a nice overview of all these performance characteristics. Super Pi SuperPi is one of the most popular benchmarks with overclockers and tweakers. It has been used in world-record competitions practically forever. It is a purely single-threaded CPU test that calculates Pi to a large number of digits—32 million for our testing. Released in 1995, it only supports x86 floating-point instructions and thus makes for a good test for single-threaded legacy application performance. Y-Cruncher Y-Cruncher is a highly optimized piece of software that can calculate Pi and other constants to a huge number of digits. It is fully multi-threaded, uses a modern code design and is optimized for all major processor architectures. This ability has made it a popular application, used by the enthusiast community to determine and compare how powerful their overclocked systems are. Rendering — Cinebench Cinebench is one of the most popular modern CPU benchmarks because it is built around the renderer of Maxon's Cinema 4D software. Both AMD and Intel have been showing this performance test at various public events, making it almost an industry standard. Using Cinebench R23, we test both single-threaded and multi-threaded performance. Rendering — Blender Blender is one of the few professional-grade rendering programs out there that is both free and open source. That fact alone helped build a strong community around the software, making it a highly popular benchmark program due to its ease of use as well. For our testing, we're using the Blender ""BMW 27"" benchmark scene with Blender 3.2. Rendering — Corona Corona Renderer is a modern photorealistic renderer that's available for Autodesk 3ds Max and Cinema 4D. It delivers physically plausible and predictable output due to its realistic lighting algorithm, global illumination, and beautiful materials. Corona does not support GPU rendering, so CPU performance is very important for all its users. We do not use the horribly outdated Corona Benchmark tool, which doesn't support new architectures, instead using the latest version, 8.2. Rendering — KeyShot The standalone KeyShot rendering software features fast and efficient workflows that help you get realistic high-quality product shots in the shortest possible time frame. Real-time ray tracing, multi-core photon mapping, adaptive material sampling, and a dynamic lighting core provide high-quality images that update instantly, even when interactively working on the scene. KeyShot 11 is optimized for usage on both CPUs and GPUs. We use the CPU renderer because the GPU renderer still has some limitations in terms of rendering capability. Rendering — V-Ray V-Ray is a world-leading 3D rendering software that uses global illumination, path tracing, photon mapping, and irradiance maps to achieve super-realistic render output. It has been used for CG in countless motion pictures and television series. V-Ray supports all major 3D applications, making it a great fit for any rendering pipeline. In this test, we're using the V-Ray 5 benchmark tool in CPU-only mode to get the number of ""vsamples"" that can be processed on a given hardware. Higher is better. Game Development — Unreal Engine 5 Unreal Engine 5 is the leading multi-platform game engine in the industry. Not only advanced, it also has lots of features to help you get results quicker than with competing products—time is money. The latest version 5 adds several new features that make the engine not only suitable for gaming, but also for architecture, automotive and movie production. Before a game is shipped, there is a lengthy process called ""build, cook and package,"" which optimizes the various assets, compiling and compressing them into versions that will work best on the target platform, before packaging them into optimized bundles ready for distribution. We use a relatively simple scene—usually this process takes several hours. Software Development — Visual Studio C++ Microsoft Visual C++ is probably the most popular programming language for creating professional Windows applications. It's part of Microsoft's Visual Studio development suite, which has a long history and is widely accepted as the gold standard when it comes to IDEs. Compiling software is a relatively lengthy process that turns program code into the final executable, and programmers hate waiting for it to complete. We run a medium-sized application through the Visual Studio 2022 C++ compiler and linker, and use the resource compiler, too. The build is executed in ""release"" mode with all optimizations turned on and multi-processor compilation enabled. Web Browsing — JetStream 2 The JetStream 2 browser benchmark combines multiple JavaScript and WebAssembly benchmarks with several advanced workloads to determine how quickly a browser can complete specific tasks. It not only rewards high overall performance, but also fast startup and consistent operation. Web Browsing — Speedometer 2 Speedometer 2 tests a ""to-do list"" web application that's implemented using a huge number of popular frameworks. Among the benchmarks are versions built with React, Ember.js, AngularJS, vue.js, jQuery and others—frameworks used by the most popular sites in the world. Web Browsing — WebXPRT WebXPRT 4 is a browser benchmark that measures the performance of typical web applications, like photo enhancement, media management using AI, stock option pricing, encryption, OCR, charting, and productivity. It contains HTML5, JavaScript, and WebAssembly-based scenarios to mirror typical everyday workloads. Machine Learning — Image Upscaling Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have enabled us to create applications that are almost magical in their abilities. In our first AI benchmark, we use Topaz Gigapixel AI to upscale a series of low resolution photos to higher resolution, while improving fine details at the same time. Machine Learning — Image Classification Teaching an AI to accurately recognize the contents of an image has always been one of the holy grails of Machine Learning research. Nero AI Photo Tagger is a consumer-oriented application that implements a simple way to use these algorithms. We let the software classify 5000 photos with tags like ""car,"" ""dog,"" or ""flower."" Machine Learning — Tensorflow Building an AI to solve complex problems first requires it to be trained through a large training data set that is evaluated repeatedly to generate a neural network that can later be put to work (also called inference). Google's Python-based Tensorflow is one of the most popular machine-learning software packages that supports both CPUs and GPUs. Setting up Tensorflow for the GPU is complicated, so lots of algorithm development and training on small data sets still happen on the CPU. Training performance on the CPU can also beat the GPU when problem sizes exceed typical GPU memory capacities. Physics Simulation COMSOL is the gold standard for the accurate simulation of physics effects and one of the strongest competitors to Ansys. Where the software shines is in solving multiphysics problems that depend on several phenomena—you can simulate everything, including black holes. The modular aspect of COMSOL helps professionals customize the software to their desires, which can be run with a single module or a whole multitude of collaborating modules for more demanding tasks, as well as with two-way communication with external programs, such as CAD software. Chemistry Simulation NAMD is developed by the University of Illinois and helps researchers simulate the dynamic interactions between molecules and atoms. It is an established means of molecular dynamics simulation that scales from individual clusters of molecules to full-on chemical interaction in different phases. Parallel simulation modes help differentiate NAMD from its peers, allowing efficient problem solving of larger systems using the Charm++ parallel programming model as the base. Medical Science — Genome Analysis COVID-19 has shown the world that deadly pandemics can bring society to a standstill. Computational genomics is essential for rapid development of vaccine candidates in a race against time. In this test we're running an analysis on a set of genomes to determine which individuals in the dataset share common traits in their DNA. This is not only a compute-intensive workload, but it also uses quite a lot of memory (over 10 GB), which makes it dependent on the performance of the memory subsystem. Microsoft Office Microsoft's Office suite needs no introduction as it's probably the most widely used PC software on the planet, installed on every office computer no matter the industry. Our tests cover a wide range of editing and creation tasks in Word, PowerPoint, Excel and Outlook. Image Editing — Adobe Photoshop Adobe Photoshop has become the industry standard for photo and image processing. We run the latest Photoshop CC through a battery of typical editing tasks, like image resize, various blurs, sharpening, color and light adjustments, and image export. We also apply more complex actions like content-aware fill, lens correction, smart sharpen, select subject, and tilt shift. Video Editing — Adobe Premiere Pro Adobe Premiere Pro CC is the workhorse of the video production industry for creating high-quality content for film, TV, and the web. It can handle pretty much every recorded file format, and supports workflows for editing Full HD, 4K, 8K, and virtual reality content. Unfortunately, most of Premiere Pro is single-threaded, and media encoding is highly GPU accelerated, so benchmarking ""export"" on the CPU makes little sense. For our testing, we're using the software's ""object tracking"" functionality, which automatically scans through a video to follow a specific person or object—this task does indeed use more than a single core, but doesn't fully scale. A lot of memory is consumed and accessed in the process, over 10 GB for our test scene. Video Production — Adobe After Effects While Premiere Pro is optimized for cutting, arranging and editing videos, Adobe After Effects is the industry standard for creating motion graphics, text rendering, color correction and other visual effects like outlines, explosions etc. When applied, each of these takes up a little bit of CPU time, so when there's many effects, processing duration will increase quite a bit. We're measuring the time it takes to export a short intro trailer, including music and sound. Create 3D Model from Photos Creating 3D models is a tedious and complex task that takes time and requires experienced artists. It's thus the holy grail of 3D modeling to reconstruct a 3D model from just a series of photos. That's exactly what Photogrammetry does. This method is also used to reconstruct terrain geometry from photos taken by aerial drones. Antivirus Scan Securing your system against viruses and malware is essential for reliable operation. Antivirus software detects unwanted programs by comparing files to a large database with thousands of signatures and rules. In this test we're measuring how long it takes to scan all files of a 30 GB game. Altium PCB Designer Altium Designer has been used to make at least one of the circuit boards inside your favorite piece of electronics. It's an industry-leading solution to build complex PCBs by automating circuit paths and ensuring that signal integrity and design rules are followed in the design. Our test measures how long it takes for Altium PCB Designer to load a project, run various operations on it, including autorouting, design rule check and finally releasing the whole design to manufacturing. Text Recognition OCR — Google Tesseract Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is the task of turning text in scanned images or photos into actual characters for archival, further processing, or editing. While most OCR software is single-threaded, Google's Tesseract engine can operate on multiple pages of a scanned document at once, spreading the load over several processor cores. The software, which is considered one of the most accurate open-source OCR packages available, automatically runs a spellcheck on the initial recognition results, which adds to the complexity of the workload. Virtualization — Oracle VirtualBox A virtual machine is a simulated computer inside your computer that's completely independent of the host PC. This not only improves security, but also enables software written for different operating systems to execute on one physical machine. Virtualization is the foundation for ""the cloud"" and helps reduce hardware ownership cost by dynamically spreading out virtual machines over multiple computers to make the best use of available hardware resources. We're testing VM performance using Oracle's VM VirtualBox software, with hardware virtualization support enabled for both Intel and AMD processors. Curiously, many motherboards ship with the virtualization setting disabled by default, so we made absolutely certain we had enabled it. Database — MySQL More data is stored and processed today than ever before in human history. Database systems that manage storage and retrieval throughout large data sets are the backbone for this revolution. Whenever you interact with a website or other digital service, one database is almost always guaranteed to be involved in returning the results you are looking for. We benchmark the most popular database system, MySQL, in the TPC-C test, which simulates a large number of warehouses and their constantly changing inventory. The reported number is ""transactions per second,"" so higher is better. Database — NoSQL While traditional relational databases are the industry standard for a lot of workloads, NoSQL databases use a different, non-tabular approach, which offers tremendous speedups for certain workloads. That's why they are used in many big data and real-time web applications today. We benchmark how long it takes MongoDB to complete 10 million requests. Java The Java programming language is designed to be platform independent, highly scalable, and fault tolerant, which is why it's very popular for enterprise services that work with large amounts of data and many concurrent users. Our test suite consists of a large mix of individual Java benchmarks, some of them single-threaded, some that scale somewhat, and some that fully scale to as many cores as are available. Web Hosting People don't like excessive load times in their browser, which makes handling all the incoming requests of a busy website in a timely manner a non-trivial task that can potentially overload some server systems. In our web server benchmark we're recording how long it takes an ASP.NET Core 6.0 based content management system to process a million requests to its ""about us"" page. Our benchmark uses an in-memory mock database to not be bottlenecked by the backing database engine. Compression — WinRAR Data is compressed almost all the time when it moves over the wire to reduce download time and transfer sizes. WinRAR uses a more advanced compression algorithm than classic ZIP, which is why we chose it for this test. It's also able to scale across multiple processor cores. Compression — 7-Zip Another popular compression software is 7-Zip, which includes a benchmark that measures the integer instruction rate (MIPS) using the ZIP algorithm. It makes good use of multiple threads, when available. Encryption — AES Encryption is the foundation for secure communication on the internet. The AES encryption standard is one of the most popular encryption algorithm these days because of its simplicity and resistance to attacks. Unlike other encryption methods, AES is symmetric, which means the same key is used for encrypting and decrypting data. Being able to quickly encrypt and decrypt information is important, which is the reason why modern processors have an instruction set extension called ""AES-NI"" that accelerates these operations. Encryption — SHA3 ""SHA"" is technically not encryption, but hashing. A cryptographic hash function is a mathematical algorithm that creates a fingerprint value for existing data. This is a one-way function, which is practically impossible to invert. Another requirement for a good hashing algorithm is that you can't create a collision: craft a message that yields a specific hash value. The SHA3 algorithm achieves all that and is also often used to authenticate transmitted data which possibly was encrypted with AES first. Sony PS3 Emulator RPCS3 is a popular PlayStation 3 emulator for PCs, which let you play many Sony PS3 titles on your favorite platform. The emulator has serious hardware requirements, and some of its emulation threads constantly need to communicate with each other, which makes it a tough workload for many CPU architectures. RPCS3 also benefits from faster cache and memory speeds, when available. Nintendo Switch Emulator Ryujinx is a highly compatible, feature-rich emulator for the Nintendo Switch console. It relies heavily on your CPU, and also comes with some tricks in how to use the memory management unit (MMU) of your processor to handle the emulated environment. While it is multi-threaded, higher single-core performance is more important than being able to scale to many cores. Media Encoding — AV1 Nowadays, all video that is consumed, whether on TV, physical media, or streamed over the internet, is compressed using various codecs. AV1 is a next-generation video codec that is open and royalty-free, unlike other recent new video compression algorithms. Major industry players like YouTube, Netflix, and Facebook stand behind AV1 and are gradually rolling out support for the new format. Compared to older algorithms, such as H.264, the compression rate is much better, or you can achieve higher image quality for a given bitrate. We use the SVT-AV1 encoder with a 4K video source to compress to AV1. Media Encoding — H.265 / HEVC Our second video-encoding test uses the H.265 codec, which is also known as HEVC. We compress a 4K video using the latest version of the X265 encoder with 8-bit color depth, preset ""slow,"" and a quality setting of crf 20. Media Encoding — H.264 / AVC H.264, also called AVC, is a slightly older compression format, though probably the most widely used these days because it is well supported, even on older hardware. We compress the same video as in the H.265 test using the X264 encoding software, with the preset ""slower"" and crf 20. Media Encoding — MP3 MP3 revolutionized the music industry like no other technology. Introduced in the 90s, it enabled a massive reduction in audio-file sizes, without noticeable impact on sound quality. This made music downloads, and ultimately streaming, a feasible method of content delivery over the Internet. For our benchmark, we convert a 2.5 hour-long 44.1 kHz Stereo recording to a variable bitrate MP3 file. MP3 encoding is a single-threaded process. Game Tests: 720p On popular demand from comments over the past several CPU reviews, we are including game tests at 720p (1280x720 pixels) resolution. All games from our CPU test suite are put through 720p using a RTX 3080 graphics card and Ultra settings. This low resolution serves to highlight theoretical CPU performance, because games are extremely CPU-limited at this resolution. Of course, nobody buys a PC with an RTX 3080 to game at 720p, but the results are of academic value because a CPU that can't do 144 frames per second at 720p will never reach that mark at higher resolutions. So, these numbers could interest high-refresh-rate gaming PC builders with fast monitors. Our 720p tests hence serve as synthetic tests in that they are not real world (720p isn't a real-world PC-gaming resolution anymore) even though the game tests themselves are not synthetic (they're real games, not 3D benchmarks). Individual Benchmark Scores Game Tests 1080p Individual Benchmark Scores Game Tests 1440p Individual Benchmark Scores Game Tests 4K Individual Benchmark Scores Integrated Graphics Performance With the Zen 4 architecture, AMD is finally adding an integrated graphics capability to all its processors. Historically Intel has offered IGP for many years in their processors, while AMD did not, which gave Intel an advantage for simple office PCs that will never see any sort of gaming. The Ryzen 7000 integrated graphics are based on the AMD RDNA 2 architecture (same as Radeon RX 5000 Series). AMD's goal with this IGP is not to provide gaming-grade performance, but to enable corporate users running 2D desktop applications like Windows, Word, Excel, and similar light-weight apps. The integrated graphics will also come in handy for troubleshooting, as you can boot and use your system without a discrete graphics card—useful in case of GPU RMA, too. Last but not least, the IGP has hardware encode/decode capabilities that can be used even when a discrete graphics card is installed, which could help offload some transcoding work from the GPU. The IGP unit is physically located inside the IO die, not in the compute die(s). Two RDNA 2 compute units offer a total of 128 cores, the GPU is clocked at a fixed 2.2 GHz. It uses the standard AMD Radeon Graphics drivers, but overclocking is not supported. All Zen 4 SKUs have the same IGP configuration. All the games on this page are running at their lowest possible detail setting (benchmarks on the ""RTX 3080"" pages use maximum settings, so they are not really comparable). Individual Benchmark Scores Frametime Analysis We present a more in-depth analysis than just average FPS to show how the framerate changes over time, which helps highlight FPS drops. Minimum FPS at both the 95th and 99th percentile are reported in these charts, too. A second chart, a histogram, shows shape and spread for the frametime data—how tightly grouped the measurements are. The ""IQR"" result is called ""Interquartile Range,"" which is an outlier-resistant statistical value that tells us the range in the middle of the frametime distribution. Ryzen 7 7700X vs Core i9-12900K Ryzen 7 7700X vs Ryzen 7 5800X Ryzen 7 7700X vs Ryzen 7 5800X3D Application Power Consumption All power measurements on this page are based on a physical measurement of the voltage, current and power flowing through the 8-pin EPS CPU power connector(s), which makes them ""CPU only"", not ""full system."" We're not using the software sensors inside the processor, as these can be quite inaccurate and will vary between manufacturers. All measurements are collected and processed at a rate of 30 data points per second, on a separate machine, so the power measurement does not affect the tested system in any way. Our new data processing pipeline allows us to link recorded data precisely with benchmark runs, so we can easily create the charts below. Gaming Power Consumption Energy Efficiency Just looking at power draw in watts won't paint the whole picture for any given processor. It's not only important how much power is consumed, but also how quickly a task is completed—taking both into account results in ""efficiency."" Since a faster processor will complete a given workload quicker, the total amount of energy used might end up less than on a low-powered processor, which might draw less power, but will take longer to finish the test. In this section, we divide the achieved performance by the power usage, to get a Cinebench points per watt single-threaded and multi-threaded result. For gaming (with GeForce RTX 3080) we divide the average FPS of all our games by the power consumed, for a frames per watt rating. All these tests are based on our CPU-only power measurements, not whole system. Temperatures We're using a Noctua NH-U14S for temperature measurements. Application temperatures are measured using Blender, a highly demanding rendering load, which will load all cores completely, but that's still realistic, not a synthetic stress test such as Prime95. For gaming, we picked Cyberpunk 2077, its modern engine is multi-thread aware and will try to spread as many tasks as possible over a large number of CPU cores, when available. Even when a game engine uses multiple threads, it doesn't load each CPU core as heavily as rendering, for example, so there's some scope for power savings here. Note that unless indicated otherwise, all processors are tested at stock conditions with their power limit active, which is why some Intel temperatures are surprisingly low. As designed by Intel, the CPU can exceed its TDP for a few seconds, but in the long term, the power limit is respected, which brings down temperatures considerably. Both tests report the steady-state temperature after an extended runtime of at least 10 minutes. Temperatures are based on delta T, normalized to 25°C. Clock Frequencies The following chart shows how well the processor sustains its clock frequency, and which boost clock speeds are achieved at various thread counts. This test uses a custom-coded application that mimics real-life performance—it is not a stress test like Prime95. Modern processors change their clocking behavior depending on the type of load, which is why we provide three plots with classic floating point math, SSE SIMD code, and modern AVX vector instructions. Each of the three test runs calculates the same result using the same algorithm, just with a different CPU instruction set. Overclocking The Ryzen 7 7700X comes with a fully unlocked multiplier, which makes multiplier-based all-core overclocking very easy. I dialed the voltage up to 1.25 V, which is about the maximum I could run Prime95 at, while not overheating by crossing 115°C—even with a powerful AIO. Using Arctic's AIO with ""Ryzen offset mounting"" helped shave a few degrees off the CPU temperature. At this voltage, with Prime95 running, I increasing the multiplier in Ryzen Master until the system became unstable. There was no way that a 5.2 GHz all-core OC would be fully stable, so I settled for 5.1 GHz. You might see some 5.2 or 5.3 GHz overclocks in other reviews, unless these were paired with exceptional custom watercooling or dry ice/LN2, there's no way these were verified to be stable with Prime95 and only lighter tests were run. Just to clarify, the limit here is not the OC ability/voltage, but the CPU temperature, which limits the voltage you can use. Performance Summary Performance per Dollar Value and Conclusion The AMD Ryzen 7 7700X will go on sale tomorrow, at a price of $400.

AMD allowed reviewers to start publishing their Zen 4 Ryzen 7000 Series processor reviews. The four new CPUs were detailed just a few weeks ago, now we can share everything with you. With Zen 4, AMD has made significant improvements to nearly all parts of their platform. It starts with the new Zen 4 architecture, which improves instruction-per-clock by well over 13% and adds support for AVX-512 and acceleration for AI workloads. Also new is that compatible motherboards use the swanky ""Socket AM5,"" which does away with the pins on the processor and uses an LGA package, similar to what Intel has been using for nearly two decades now. The new socket has support for all the latest technologies: PCI-Express 5.0 for graphics and NVMe storage; DDR5 memory, and also higher power delivery capability. Last but not least, AMD is finally including integrated graphics across the board, even with their non-APU processors, which will be extremely useful when building a rig that will only see light activity, such as office productivity, light browsing, or a media PC. In this review we're examining the Ryzen 7 7700X, which is the company's 8-core/16-thread offering for Zen 4. The chip runs at a base clock of 4.5 GHz and boosts up to 5.4 GHz—an 800 MHz increase over the 5700X. AMD has also increased the TDP from 65 W to 105 W, which brings with it more headroom for boosting to higher clocks, but also increases cooling requirements, but more on that later. We've spent months working on a new and improved CPU benchmarking suite, with tons of new apps and games, and every processor was retested with the latest Windows 11 updates, game patches and drivers. Averaged over our 45 application tests, we find the Ryzen 7 7700X a highly impressive 30% faster than its Ryzen 7 5700X predecessor, and 20% faster than the 5800X. That 30% is a huge increase in performance, gen-over-gen, and AMD achieved it without increasing the core count—7700X is still an 8-core processor. This makes performance slightly faster than the outgoing Intel Core i7-12700K, which needs eight P-Cores, plus four E-Cores (8P+4E) to keep up. Another impressive achievement is that the Ryzen 7700X beats AMD's last generation flagship, the Ryzen 9 5950X, by a small margin in application performance. Intel's i9-12900K is only 7% faster in applications, the Ryzen 9 7900X, also released today, is 15% faster, and the 7950X impresses with a 26% lead. In gaming, Zen 4 can also deliver. At 1080p, the 7700X is the fastest Zen 4 processor for gaming—yes, even faster than the 7950X. The underlying reason is that the 7900X and 7950X use a dual-CCD design, where the processor's computation ability is spread across two silicon dies, while the 7600X and 7700X use only a single CCD. This single CCD configuration helps make a difference in gaming, because things are better localized and there's no inter-CCD latency penalties. The differences are small though, the other Ryzens are still formidable CPUs for gaming, but if gaming is your primary focus, then the 7700X is your best choice. The Ryzen 7 5800X3D is a fantastic gaming processor, but on average, for our 12-game mix, the 7700X can pull ahead. Where the 5800X3D will still have an edge is in specific highly-CPU bound games that can benefit from its huge cache (such as Borderlands 3). Gaming performance on Intel is still a tiny bit better than Zen 4, at least with our selection of games, as long as you have an Intel CPU with P-Cores and E-Cores—the P-Core-only Intel 12600 and 12400F in our test group do lose to Zen 4 in gaming. In early summer, way before we had any Zen 4 samples, I picked titles based on their relevance and popularity; and it seems the games list tends to run a bit better on Intel than what a general average over many more titles would end up at. I have plans to test Zen 4 on a wider range of games, 50 is the target, to get a better statistical feel for this. Both AMD Zen 4 and Intel Alder Lake are fantastic processor series for gaming, and in a subjective test without an FPS counter you wouldn't be able to tell their performance apart. For gaming targeting the highest FPS, the processor is secondary, you should rather spend as much money as possible on the graphics card and pair it with a more affordable processor, instead of focusing on brute CPU performance at the cost of GPU budget. AMD is fabricating the Zen 4 compute dies on TSMC's 5 nanometer production process, and the I/O die is made on TSMC 6 nanometer. Just these numbers alone would suggest that Zen 4 is extremely energy efficient, but it seems clocking Ryzen 7000 at these high frequencies and TDPs has cost AMD quite some efficiency. We've upgraded our power measurement pipeline, and can now measure ""chip-only"" power consumption (as opposed to ""whole system"" before), and we record samples much faster, with full integration of the results. This lets us pair up power measurements with individual benchmark runs and perform more complex analyses, check out page 23. Compared to the Ryzen 7 5700X, the 7700X has lost around 15% in energy efficiency, but does offer much better performance overall, a reasonable tradeoff in my opinion. You can always dial down the clocks and voltages a bit, and greatly improve efficiency with minimal impact on performance. Compared to Intel's offerings, the Zen 4 architecture is miles ahead in power-draw. Especially when comparing against the i9-12900K, it's difficult to justify the additional power draw on Intel. The Intel i7-12700K comes with more sane power limits and is roughly in the same ballpark as the 7700X when it comes to power and efficiency. What will be a big source of discussion for Zen 4 is the extremely high temperatures. Using our high-end Noctua air cooler, there was a constant struggle trying to keep the CPU from its 95°C thermal limit - at which point it will start lowering boost clocks. Even adding all-in-one watercooling wasn't able to make a significant difference. The only AIO that showed meaningful gains over air was the Arctic Liquid Freezer II 240, which offers an ""offset mounting"" configuration that moves the center of the cold plate away from the center of the CPU to sit right on top of the compute dies on Zen 4. This gained us a couple of degrees improvement, so we could test the performance impact of hitting the 95°C temperature limit. I'm happy to report that there is only minimal loss in performance, maybe a few percent, as long as you have a good air cooler. AMD is very clear in their cooler guidance for 7950X and 7900X, mentioning ""240-280 mm liquid,"" but the 7700X and 7600X are supposed to be paired with ""mid-frame tower coolers,"" which I feel is a bit less than what I would recommend. AMD was also clear that 95°C is the new 65°C: ""TJMax is the max safe operating temperature—not the absolute max temperature. In the Ryzen 7000 Series, the processor is designed to run at TJMax 24/7 without risk of damage or deterioration. At 95 degrees it is not running hot, rather it will intentionally go to this temperature as much as possible under load because the power management system knows that this is the ideal way to squeeze the most performance out of the chip without damaging it."" I'm just surprised that temperatures are so high. Maybe it's the smaller die size of the compute dies, paired with high clocks and voltage that leads to these temperatures, or some compromises were made to achieve compatibility with AM4 coolers, or maybe both. I'm sure in the coming months we'll learn more about the cooling challenges, how to overcome them, and cooler vendors will probably release solutions optimized for Socket AM5. Right now you need to be aware that cooling Zen 4 is much more difficult than Zen 3, and that you should really stop worrying about 95°C temperatures. AMD is very clear in their messaging that these temps are normal and expected. During testing I didn't encounter any major bugs or issues; the whole AM5 / X670 platform works very well, considering how many new features it brings; there's one big gotcha though, and that's startup time duration. When powering on for the first time after a processor install, your system will spend at least a minute with memory training at POST code 15 before the BIOS screen appears. When I first booted up my Zen 4 sample I assumed it was hung and kept resetting/clearing CMOS. After first boot, the super long startup times improve, but even with everything set up and installed, you'll stare at a blank screen for 30 seconds. To clarify: after a clean system shutdown, without loss of power, when you press the power button you're still looking at a black screen for 30 seconds, before the BIOS logo finally appears. I find that an incredibly long amount of time, especially when you're not watching the POST code display that tells you something is happening. Most motherboards don't even have a POST code readout, and rely on LEDs to tell you which stage of the POST the machine is running at. The LED will seem ""stuck"" at memory or CPU. For cheaper boards that lack even this, there will be an unnerving wait. AMD and the motherboard manufacturers say they are working on improving this—they must. I'm having doubts that your parents would accept such an experience as an ""upgrade"", considering their previous computer showed something on-screen within seconds after pressing the power button. Update Sep 29 : I just tested boot times using the newest ASUS 0703 Beta BIOS, which comes with AGESA ComboAM5PI 1.0.0.3 Patch A. No noticeable improvement in memory training times. It takes 38 seconds from pressing the power button (after a clean Windows shutdown), until there ASUS BIOS POST screen shots. After that, the usual BIOS POST stuff happens and Windows still start, which takes another 20 seconds or so. Just like previous AMD Ryzen processors, all AMD Zen 4 CPUs come with unlocked multipliers, which makes overclocking much easier. Our highest manual all-core OC turned out to be only 5.1 GHz, held back by the fact that it's impossible to keep the fully loaded CPU under 100°C, even with a large AIO. This means that you're limited in how much voltage you can feed the beast, and you thus end up with much lower manual clocks. You could decide to not run Prime95, and test stability with lighter loads only, but that's not what I consider a stable OC. I ran all our benchmarks at 5.1 GHz All-Core OC, and this config ends up slower than the 7700X at stock in all tests, so unless you have exceptional cooling or are super lucky with the silicon lottery, it makes no sense to go for an all-core OC, not even for rendering workloads. The better way to OC Ryzen is using PBO ""Auto Overclocking,"" paired with Curve Optimizer, same as Zen 3. Spending just a few minutes on that will yield you a few percent in OC performance—not a lot, but the times of huge OC gains are firmly a thing of the past—CPU manufacturers are getting better and better at giving you the best performance out of the box. As mentioned previously, Zen 4 now comes with integrated graphics. These ""just work""—if no discrete graphics card is installed, plug the monitor cable in the motherboard, boom, everything works. Windows Update will install the right driver, or you can grab the official AMD Radeon drivers. Overall IGP performance is outstanding, and plenty for everything except serious gaming. Some lighter 3D apps like Google Earth work perfectly fine too, and are hardware-accelerated, just like all video decode and encode workloads for video conferencing, for example. While AMD is very clear that the integrated graphics are not for gaming, I still ran our IGP test suite and have to say I'm impressed—the Zen 4 IGP roughly matches the IGP of the Core i9-12900K, which uses Intel's latest Xe architecture and that they've spent a ton of die area on. A real, discrete graphics card is still much faster, even the most entry-level Radeon RX 6400 offers four times (!) the FPS. For all other typical consumer activities, these integrated graphics are awesome and they'll be a huge selling factor for compact, or cost-optimized office systems, a market where Intel has traditionally dominated, because discrete graphics cards weren't required. AMD is pricing the Ryzen 7 7700X at $400, slightly below the $450 price point that the Ryzen 7 5800X launched at. Why am I comparing the 7700X with the 5800X? Because the 7700X is really the ""7800X"" of this generation, AMD just changed the naming, to make it easier to position an upcoming ""Ryzen 7 7800X3D,"" and probably to align with Intel, who offer no x800 SKU either. On the 5800X3D, AMD had to lower the clock frequencies, so the 3DV Cache could be used, which led to a situation in which 5800X was faster in some workloads than 5800X3D—AMD want to avoid that naming mess this time. Right now the Ryzen 7 5800X costs only $295, the 5700X goes for $245, and the 5800X3D is $430. When comparing against these price points, the 7700X does feel expensive, but it offers much better performance too. Overall platform cost of Ryzen 7000 is however, very high. The new motherboards are extremely expensive, and there's only X670/X670E available for now, the more affordable B650 boards will be released in October. While Intel supports both DDR4 and DDR5, AMD is focusing exclusively on DDR5, saying that this will eventually help adoption rates of DDR5, which enables higher production volumes, which will bring memory pricing down. Nothing wrong there, and while the performance gains from DDR5 are substantial, it still drives up platform cost. Basically you're looking at $1000+ for Zen 4+board+memory whereas $500 will get you a solid Zen 3 setup that offers somewhat slower performance, but at half the price. For gamers, this means you could go one or two tiers higher in your graphics card choice, which would definitely result in an FPS increase. Intel's 12700K is $400 right now, with similar performance, and cheaper motherboards available, so that's strong competition too, and Intel's new 13th gen processors are getting announced this week. It seems like the CPU market will become even more interesting in the coming months, and I'd expect that AM5/DDR5 platform prices will go down in the closing months of 2022, and through 2023. Our awards explainedContinuing with our AMD Zen 4 review tour , this time we're putting the new Ryzen 7 7700X to the test. From a gaming perspective, this is the CPU we've been most interested to examine: it's an 8-core, 16-thread chip using a single CCD, which should mean when it comes to gaming it's going to deliver the best performance. The Ryzen 7 7700X clocks between 4.7 GHz and 5.4 GHz depending on the load, it's composed of a single 5nm core complex die with a 6nm I/O die, packs 32MB of L3 cache, 6MB of L2, DDR5 support, 28 PCIe 5.0 lanes, a 105w TDP, and is designed for AMD's new AM5 platform. This CPU succeeds the Zen 3-based 5800X , which was also an octa-core and featured a launch MSRP of $450. The Ryzen 7 7700X is launching at $400, which is an 11% discount for what should be a much faster processor. Of course, at present the 5800X can be had for as little as $260 , which remains a solid option for those on the AM4 platform that are looking to upgrade. A closer rival in terms of pricing for the 7700X could be the 5800X3D , which currently costs $430, slightly more than the 7700X and that's going to make for a very interesting match up. We have 17 CPUs set up for comparison: for the AM4 platform we have a range of Zen 2 and Zen 3 CPUs, then we've got the Intel 10th-gen Core series including popular Core i5, i7 and i9 models. We have skipped Intel's 11th-gen series and instead focused on 12th-gen Alder Lake with tests using both DDR4-3200 dual-rank CL14 memory and DDR5-6400 single-rank CL32 memory, with models going from the Core i3-12100 up to the Core i9-12900K . The AM5 platform was represented by the MSI MEG X670E Ace motherboard using what AMD said was an ideal RAM setup with DDR5-6000 CL30 memory. All testing was conducted using the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti , Windows 11, and Resizable BAR was enabled for all configurations. Clock Speeds As we've shown with other Zen 4 CPU reviews, here's a look at clock behavior in Cinebench . After an hour of load testing, the 7700X maintained an all-core frequency of 5.1 GHz. This was sustained using the be quiet! Pure Loop 2 FX 360mm liquid cooler installed inside the Silent Base 802 case. For single core workloads the 7700X appeared to maintain a clock frequency of 5.55 GHz, so 150 MHz above the advertised clock frequency. Application Benchmarks In Cinebench R23 we find the 7700X roughly matching the previous generation's 12-core part, the 5900X , coming in just 3% slower. This makes it 13% slower than the 12700K , which can be had for the same price, suggesting that the productivity benchmarks might not be all that smooth sailing for the new 8-core Zen 4 processor. Single-core performance is slightly better than the 12700K, though only ever so slightly, but in terms of single core performance it does make the 7700X one of the best CPUs on the market right now. Performance in 7-Zip is amazing, as has been the case with all Zen 4 processors that we've looked at so far. Here it can be seen beating the 16-core 3950X while coming in behind the previous generation 16-core 5950X by a mere 7% margin, half the cores yet just 7% slower, that's an amazing result. All that said, it was still 8% slower than the 12700K , so despite offering a huge leap forward from the previous generation, it's a little disappointing compared to Alder Lake given the price. AMD's SMT is far more powerful for decompression work and as a result the 7700X crushes the 12700K in this opportunity, offering nearly 20% more performance and matching the Core i9-12900K. The Blender Open Data results place the 7700X alongside the 3900X and 12700K, a great result as it was just 10% slower than the 12-core 5900X. Therefore when compared to its predecessor, the 5800X, the 7700X is 27% faster. The Corona benchmark results are also impressive as the 7700X nudged ahead of the 3900X , 10900K , and beat the 5800X by a 21% margin. Disappointingly, it was 7% slower than the 12700K. That's not a massive margin but given they both cost $400 you'd hope AMD could have beaten what is essentially a year-old competitor at this point. We've seen the Ryzen 9 7950X dominate the Premiere Pro benchmark before and here we can see that the 7700X is just as impressive, beating even the 5950X by a 10% margin and crushing the 12700K by almost 40%. The Photoshop results are splendid. Here the 7700X was 19% faster than the 12700K and 28% faster than the 5800X. This makes it the fastest CPU we've ever tested as it managed to beat even the 7950X. The Ryzen 7 7700X performed well in Adobe After Effects, though it wasn't quite as dominant, only nudging ahead of the 12700K. It was much faster than the 5800X though, offering a little over 30% greater performance. Code compilation performance shows the 7700X doing well again, matching the 12700K depending on the memory configuration used by the Intel Alder Lake CPU. An impressive result that made it 8% faster than the 5900X and a massive 50% faster than the 5800X. Gaming Benchmarks Time for the gaming benchmarks and we'll start with Factorio, which is very cache sensitive and only looks at single core performance. The Ryzen 7 7700X slots right between the 7600X and 7950X making it one of the faster CPUs we've tested in Factorio and around 6% faster than the 12700K, a solid result overall. The 7700X was mighty impressive in Watch Dogs Legion, jumping ahead of the 7600X by a 10% margin and even edging out the 7950X. This placed it roughly on par with the 12900K using DDR5 memory and a massive 30% ahead of the 5800X. It's rare and almost unheard of to see a single CPU generation boost gaming performance by this much, especially given Zen 3 was no slouch. Next we have Rainbow Six Extraction and as we've seen previously with other Zen 4 chips, the 7700X isn't amazing in this title. While this more middle of the pack result looks average, it's worth noting that the 7700X is within 3% of the fastest tested CPU, the 12900K using DDR5 memory, so it's not a bad result at all. The Ryzen 7950X and 7600X results were already impressive in Hitman 3 and with the 7700X we're getting more of the same as it managed to nudge ahead by just a few frames. This did mean that the 7700X was 7% faster than the 12700K using DDR5 memory, not a massive win, but it was impressive to see the Zen 4 CPU come out on top. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is a good representation of how CPU demanding many modern games are. This game can be useful for testing low-end CPUs, but for the 7700X it just shows us that we're able to max out the RTX 3090 Ti here, matching other high-end CPUs. Moving on to F1 22, we see that the 7700X pushes further ahead hitting 343 fps on average making it 18% faster than the 12700K and impressively 7% faster than the 5800X3D. We're also looking at a massive 28% uplift from the 5800X, which is another ~30% generational leap for gaming from AMD. In Spider-Man Remastered results are good despite the fact that the 7700X trails the 12700K by a 5% margin. A bit disappointing in that regard, but when compared to the previous Ryzen generation, it's mighty impressive offering 26% more performance than the 5800X. It appears as though we've reached the limits of the RTX 3090 Ti in Shadow of the Tomb Raider using the highest quality preset at 1080p. Even the 1% lows are no longer improving, at least beyond a frame here and there. Compared to the 12700K, we're looking at a similar average frame rate with a minimal boost to 1% lows. The Zen 4 CPUs have all been impressive in Horizon Zero Dawn and while the 7700X takes out top spot here, it was just 1% faster than the 7600X. The gain over the 5800X wasn't big either, though 12% is nothing to scoff at, but the 20% gain over the 12700K was far more impressive. When compared to the 7600X, the 1% lows of the 7700X are much better in Cyberpunk 2077 and yet despite that it's still much slower than competing Alder Lake parts such as the 12700K, trailing by a notable 10% margin with 153 fps on average opposed to 170 fps. We've seen before how the 5800X3D is a beast in ACC, rushing everything and Zen 4 hasn't changed that, at least not these non-3D V-Cache models. The 7700X trailed the 5800X3D by a 12% margin, though it was still 14% faster than the 12700K. The Riftbreaker isn't too forgiving for Ryzen processors and there appears to be a bug with the dual CCD on the 7950X, which AMD says the developer is looking into. The 7950X should be able to match the 7700X and that would make it one of the fastest CPUs in this title. The 7700X didn't crush the competition, but it was able to pull ahead of the 12700K by a 4% margin which is a solid result considering how uncompetitive Zen 3 is in this title. The Ryzen 7 7700X is very fast in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, taking out top spot, beating even the 7950X. We're looking at an impressive 543 fps, making it a massive 29% faster than the 12700K and almost 50% faster than the 5800X , so that's a stellar result to say the least. 12 Game Average Performance The Ryzen 7 7700X has come out strong in gaming tests as we had expected, taking top spot in our testing, narrowly beating the 12900K using DDR5 memory by a 2% margin. Then when compared to the similarly priced 12700K, it was 6% faster and a massive 21% faster than the previous-gen 5800X . It's encouraging to see that all three Zen 4 CPUs tested so far are faster than the 5800X3D, and that's not something we were expecting to find going into this testing. Power Consumption Here's a quick look at power consumption for an all-core workload. The Ryzen 7 7700X pushed total system power usage slightly higher than the 5900X , but did manage to come in under the 12700K. In a nutshell, the 7700X is not better than either CPU in terms of performance per watt, at least for all core workloads like we see here with Blender. Cooling Performance When it comes to cooling, Zen 4 CPUs give the impression that they're difficult to cool by delivering as much performance as possible by taking full advantage of the thermal and power headroom. AMD says with the new AM5 platform and higher TDP, Zen 4 processors will run into a thermal wall before they hit a power wall. This means under heavy load they'll sit at TJMax which is about 95 degrees Celsius for the Ryzen 7000 series, and this will be particularly true for the 12 and 16-core models. AMD has stressed that this behavior is by design and it's important to note TJMax is the maximum safe operating temperature – not the absolute maximum temperature. AMD went on to say that 95C is not running hot, rather Zen 4 will intentionally go to this temperature under load because the power management system knows that this is the ideal way to squeeze the most performance out of the chip without damaging it. The processors are designed to run at TJMax 24/7 without risk of damage or deterioration they added. On the upside, almost all AM4 coolers will be compatible with AM5, except for those that are secured from the rear side of the motherboard as the backplates aren't removable on AM5 boards. This means that all coolers can be installed without requiring rear access to the motherboard, as is the case with HEDT processors, so that's good news. For testing we used the be quiet! Pure Loop 2 FX 360mm liquid cooler which is fully AM5 compatible. After an hour of looping Cinebench R23 multi-core, we recorded a peak CPU temperature of 97C, just above the 95C TJMax that AMD says the CPU targets for maximum performance. It will be interesting to revisit Zen 4 later using a range of coolers to see how cooling performance affects CPU performance. But that's an investigation for another time. Cost vs. Performance Now lets do a value analysis, starting with the cost per frame of just the CPU. The 7700X is on average only 5% faster than the 7600X , but costs 33% more which makes sense as you are getting 33% more cores. For gaming though that much CPU power isn't required and probably won't be for some time, so the 7700X comes in at a 27% price premium per frame. Still, when compared to competing Intel parts such as the 12700K and 12900K , the 7700X is better value when just looking at the CPU cost. Taking a look at cost per frame while including memory and motherboard costs – which for the DDR4 configurations includes a 32GB kit of DDR4-3200 CL14 memory at a cost of $200, and the DDR5 configurations cost $280, regardless of the spec, both 6000 and 6400 cost the same amount. For the motherboard, the AM5 models are based on the $290 MSI Pro X670-P WiFi, AM4 uses the Asus TUF Gaming X570-Plus WiFi which costs $180, and then the MSI Pro Z690-P DDR4 at $180 and the MSI Pro Z690-A DDR5 at $210. Based on those prices, the 7700X isn't amazing value, but for flagship-tier performance, it still beats out the 12900K while offering similar value to the 12700K. It's also just 6% more costly per frame than the 7600X, making it an attractive option for those seeking ultimate performance. Like the 7600X, the 7700X is weak in terms of value when it comes to core-heavy productivity, both delivering worse value than even the Core i9-12900K. The more expensive Ryzen 9 7950X is worlds better here, so if productivity is the priority then you can ignore 6 and 8-core Zen 4 options. For mixed workloads that rely on strong single and multi-core performance, the 7700X does fare much better and takes out top spot for value in the Premiere Pro benchmark. So when it comes to productivity it will depend on the application, but notice that the 7950X was still faster, so if time's money then that's the way you'd go. What We Learned The Ryzen 7 7700X looks to be the new king of gaming, at least for now, taking out the Core i9-12900K in our 12 game sample. Of course, we'll be keen to compare them head-to-head across 30+ games, and that's something we plan to do soon, though we'll wait for next-gen GPUs before sinking a week into that testing. When compared to existing Intel Alder Lake CPUs for gaming, the 7700X appears to be the superior option from a performance standpoint, while offering a similar level of value to the 12700K , and much better value than the 12900K . That said, if you're prioritizing productivity then the choice between the Alder Lake i7 and i9 parts and the 7700X is less obvious, but in the end it may not matter as you'd just opt for the Ryzen 9 7950X which is much faster, or perhaps the 7900X which we'll be looking at next. Perhaps a more difficult decision for prospective buyers is the choice between the 7600X and 7700X. Right now the 7600X is better value, even when factoring the entire platform cost, but if you're going to build an entire PC from the ground up, the 8-core model will only cost you a few percent more at most, so at that point you might as well part with the $100. On average, the Ryzen 7 7700X is just 3% faster for gaming, though we did see instances where it was up to 11% faster. Realistically, the 7600X is still going to be better value as gaming performance is very similar and this will almost certainly hold true for years to come, just as we've seen in the past. Remember when 8-core CPUs were all the rave for gaming? Remember when 8-core CPUs were all the rave for gaming? If we look at the 12 game sample, which is largely based on modern titles, the Ryzen 7 3700X is on average just 4% faster than the 3600, so even though the older CPUs are significantly slower than newer Zen 4 models, core scaling is remarkably similar. Likewise, the 3950X is just 4% faster than the 3700X, so it's almost guaranteed that within the realistic lifespan of these processors the 7950X won't overtake the 7700X for gaming, say within the next 5 to 8 years. Keeping all of that in mind, the Ryzen 7 7700X is actually our Zen 4 recommendation for gamers. At present AM5 is an expensive platform and if you're faced with having to spend well over $200 on DDR5 memory and the same for an entry-level X670 motherboard, there's little point saving $100 on the 6-core CPU. This recommendation will likely change with the arrival of sub-$200 AMD B650 boards and we've already got a few of those on hand, but are not allowed to show them off yet. DDR5 pricing will almost certainly continue to fall, so in a few months the 7600X should make sense as a sort of AM5 value option. For now though I would overlook it for the 7700X. Which brings us to the conclusion that holding off for a month or two might pay in more ways than you imagine. There's cheaper DDR5 memory at play, but also to see what Intel brings to the table with Raptor Lake, their 13th-gen Core series. It will need to be exceptionally good to overthrow the 7700X and also counter the AM5 platform which will let you upgrade later. A strong argument for spending big on a quality AMD AM5 motherboard now is that you'll still be using it in 2025 and have the option to slot a Zen 6 CPU on there for what should be a massive upgrade. With Intel, on the other hand, you will require a new motherboard in 3 years, a direction we hope they set to change in the generation that comes after Raptor Lake. "
4,INTEL i5 13600k,"Introduction The Core i5-13600K leads the performance-segment of the company's swanky new 13th Gen Core ""Raptor Lake"" desktop processor family. This $300-ish market segment attracts a wide range of users, from gamers to creators on a budget. You get almost the entire feature-set of the series, at a lower core-count. It joins the Core i9-13900K, which we've also reviewed for you today; besides the i7-13700K. While the Core i5 desktop processor series have historically spanned mid-range prices, Intel has done several value-additions to Core i5 over the years, such that it created two sub-series—the Core i5 K/KF-series, and the non-K/KF; with the two having distinct CPU core-configurations, L3 cache sizes, and other features. The 13th Gen Core ""Raptor Lake"" series brings with it generational CPU core-count increases, and the same holds true even for the Core i5-13600K. The chip gets six performance cores (or P-cores), and eight efficient cores (E-cores). This 6P+8E configuration is higher than the 6P+4E one of the previous-generation i5-12600K ""Alder Lake,"" and while it might seem insignificant, given that only the E-core count has increased; Intel also replaced the P-cores with the new ""Raptor Cove"" ones that come with higher IPC, larger caches, and faster clock speeds. The 13th Gen Core ""Raptor Lake"" is Intel's second rodeo with the Hybrid architecture, the 12th Gen Core helped it shore up CPU core-counts and chase down AMD's lead in that area, and Intel is smart about it: the silicon only has six or eight P-cores, which Intel wagers are sufficient for taking on compute-intensive less parallelized tasks; while a swarm of physically smaller E-cores handles most light to moderate workloads, and in a crunch situation (all cores loaded); can contribute greatly to the processor's overall multi-threaded performance. So AMD's advantage with gaming performance is overcome with the high clock-speed P-cores, and its advantage with multi-threaded creator workloads is dusted by E-cores working in concert with the P-cores. With ""Raptor Lake,"" Intel is introducing new ""Raptor Cove"" P-cores that come with higher IPC (single-threaded performance at a given clock speed); the ability to sustain higher clock-speeds generationally; and higher amounts of dedicated L2 cache—increased to 2 MB compared to 1.25 MB on the ""Golden Cove"" cores of ""Alder Lake."" While the E-cores are the same ""Gracemont"" ones, the E-core counts have increased generationally, as did their clock speeds and L2 cache sizes. Each ""Gracemont"" 4-core cluster now shares 4 MB of L2 caches among the cores, compared to 2 MB on ""Alder Lake."" The Core i5-13600K has two such clusters, and hence eight E-cores. The shared L3 cache size has increased, too, which is now 24 MB compared to 20 MB on the i5-12600K. The 13th Gen Core ""Raptor Lake"" processors are built on the same Socket LGA1700 package as the 12th Gen, and are compatible with existing Intel 600-series chipset motherboards via BIOS updates; although they are accompanied by the 700-series chipset motherboards with improved power architecture and downstream PCIe connectivity. The new processors support the same I/O as the 12th Gen, with PCI-Express 5.0 x16 PEG, one PCI-Express 4.0 x4 NVMe slot wired to the processor, and DMI 4.0 x8 chipset-bus. The processors support both DDR4 and DDR5 memory types, improving choice for the consumers. Intel is pricing the Core i5-13600K at USD $320, a similar price to that of the i5-12600K, and $20 higher than the competing Ryzen 5 7600X. It features a 6P+8E core configuration, and the P-cores tick at 3.50 GHz with a maximum boost frequency of 5.10 GHz, while the E-cores do 2.60 GHz, with up to 3.90 GHz boost. The processor base power (PBP) value is the same as the other processor models launching today, at 125 W, while the maximum turbo power is generationally increased, it's now 181 W. In this review, the i5-13600K squares off against the bulk of the $250-$400 desktop processor segment that's cluttered with chips such as the i5-12600K, 7600X, 7700X, and even i7-12700KF. If you can live without integrated graphics, you can opt for the i5-13600KF over the i5-13600K, which is practically identical, but $25 cheaper, at $295. The ""Raptor Lake"" microarchitecture is the swansong of monolithic silicon client processors for Intel. Future generations will implement the IDM 2.0 product design, and will be multi-chip modules with chiplets built across various foundry nodes. The ""Raptor Lake"" silicon is fabricated on the same Intel 7 (10 nm Enhanced SuperFin) foundry node as the previous-gen ""Alder Lake,"" although Intel claims to have squeezed out a handful ofprovements, such as better electron channel mobility, which can let both the P-cores and E-cores gain increases in clock speeds by as much as 600 MHz over the previous-generation, and minimally higher power. The transistor-density is unchanged, since it's the same the node. The ""Raptor Lake"" die measures 23.8 mm x 11.8 mm (257 mm² die-area). The channel mobility improvements on the Intel 7 node in particular lets the chip designers raise the V/F curve, with over 50 mV reduction in iso-frequency (voltage needed for frequency); over 200 MHz iso-voltage (frequency increase at a given voltage); which enables up to 600 MHz increase in Turbo Boost frequencies, with the increase of maximum turbo power (MTP) to as high as 253 W for the Core i9-13900K and i7-13700K; and as high as 181 W for the Core i5-13600K. The ""Raptor Cove"" performance cores (P-cores) come with increased IPC, and while the company didn't specify the IPC gain over the previous-generation ""Golden Cove"" P-core, it mentions an over 15% single-threaded performance uplift. The ISA of the ""Raptor Cove"" core is identical to that of ""Golden Cove,"" but the company has enhanced the hardware prefetcher dealing with the dedicated L2 cache. Helping the P-core performance uplift are the node improvements that help it sustain higher frequencies, and larger dedicated L2 cache—now 2 MB compared to 1.25 MB for ""Golden Cove."" The i9-13900K and i7-13700K get eight ""Raptor Cove"" P-cores, which come with HyperThreading enabled, so 16 threads from the P-cores. The Core i5-13600K gets six of these P-cores, for 12 threads. The ""Gracemont"" E-cores are architecturally unchanged from ""Alder Lake,"" but are tuned with higher frequencies, and the most important hardware-level change is the L2 cache. Groups of four E-cores are organized as E-core clusters, which share an L2 cache among the cores. Intel doubled this cache size from 2 MB on ""Alder Lake"" to 4 MB. Much like the P-cores, Intel has updated the L2 cache prefetcher algorithm for E-core clusters. The ""Raptor Lake"" silicon physically features four E-core clusters, so 16 E-cores in total. The Core i7-13700K is carved out by disabling two of these clusters, giving you eight E-cores; while the i5-13600K is designed by disabling two E-core clusters, as well as two P-cores, for its 6P+8E configuration. Intel made several other updates to the cache and memory sub-system besides the enlarged L2 caches mentioned above. The shared L3 cache is now as large as 36 MB for the Core i9 SKUs, 30 MB for the Core i7 SKUs, and 24 MB for the Core i5 K/KF SKUs. The Ring Bus interconnect continues to be the town-square for this silicon, and Intel has increased its frequency by 900 MHz, now up to 5.00 GHz (it ran up to 4.10 GHz on the i9-12900K). The new Dynamic INI (inclusive/non-inclusive) architecture lets components reserve portions of the L3 cache to themselves to minimize cache misses or DRAM roundtrips if the cache is saturated. The processor supports dual-channel DDR5 and DDR4 memory types (2x 64-bit channels in case of DDR4, 4x 32-bit sub-channels in case of DDR5). The chip now supports DDR5-5600 natively (JEDEC spec), while the native DDR4 frequency is unchanged at DDR4-3200. While it didn't put out detailed architectural block-diagrams of its CPU cores like it did the last time, Intel was kind enough to give us a breakdown of how it achieved its claimed 15% single-threaded performance uplift, and >40% multi-threaded uplift. Generational increases to frequency, cache size and prefetcher improvements, and and memory frequency uplifts, add to these. Multi-threaded performance uplift rides on the back of all these; plus the doubling in E-core count. Contributing to not just multi-threaded performance, but also consistency in multi-threaded performance across applications, are a series of updates to Intel Thread Director, the hardware-level middleware that makes Intel's Hybrid architecture work with software, by directing the right kind of workload to the right kind of CPU cores. It collaborates with OS scheduler improvements of Windows 11 22H2, particularly with smarter QoS (performance outlay) for background tasks. All processor models being launched today are Unlocked K (or KF) SKUs, letting you go to town with overclocking. While there are no new overclocking handles with ""Raptor Lake,"" Intel improved the software side of things, by giving Extreme Tuner Utility (XTU) new per-core multiplier settings for both the P-cores and E-cores; and a simplified UI for automated overclocking, with Speed Optimizer. Intel Z790 Chipset Alongside the six 13th Gen K-series processors SKUs, Intel is debuting the Z790 chipset. Motherboards based on this are guaranteed to come with out-of-the-box support for 13th Gen processors, even though 600-series chipset motherboards support them via a BIOS update, and many of them feature USB BIOS Flashback. The Z790 sees a rebalancing of the downstream PCIe connectivity in favor of more downstream Gen 4 PCIe lanes, compared to the previous-gen Z690. You will find Z790 motherboards with DDR5 memory support, as well as those with DDR4 support—Intel hasn't restricted motherboard vendors from doing so. Unboxing and Photography As we detailed in our Unboxing Article, our Core i9-13900K and i5-13600K samples came in special media-kits. It's basically a flashy paperboard box the size of an M-ATX motherboard box, with the two processors inside, and some mementos designed to look like the ""Raptor Lake"" die. The memento should go well as a backdrop item for video-format tech journalists. The retail Core i5-13600K comes in a simple paperboard box, which lacks a boxed cooler. The Core i5-13600K processor package looks like the 12th Gen processors, as it shares the same LGA1700 socket. It's backwards-compatible with 600-series chipset motherboards with BIOS update. Many of the premium models come with USB Flashback. The retail Core i5-13600K box doesn't include a cooler, but you can pick up just any LGA1700 cooler—there's plenty of choice. Just make sure it can handle the thermal load.

AIDA64 comes with a great benchmark that provides a nice overview over all these performance characteristics. Super Pi SuperPi is one of the most popular benchmarks with overclockers and tweakers. It has been used in world-record competitions practically forever. It is a purely single-threaded CPU test that calculates Pi to a large number of digits—32 million for our testing. Released in 1995, it only supports x86 floating-point instructions and thus makes for a good test for single-threaded legacy application performance. Y-Cruncher Y-Cruncher is a highly optimized piece of software that can calculate Pi and other constants to a huge number of digits. It is fully multi-threaded, uses a modern code design and is optimized for all major processor architectures. This ability has made it a popular application, used by the enthusiast community to determine and compare how powerful their overclocked systems are. Rendering — Cinebench Cinebench is one of the most popular modern CPU benchmarks because it is built around the renderer of Maxon's Cinema 4D software. Both AMD and Intel have been showing this performance test at various public events, making it almost an industry standard. Using Cinebench R23, we test both single-threaded and multi-threaded performance. Rendering — Blender Blender is one of the few professional-grade rendering programs out there that is both free and open source. That fact alone helped build a strong community around the software, making it a highly popular benchmark program due to its ease of use as well. For our testing, we're using the Blender ""BMW 27"" benchmark scene with Blender 3.2. Rendering — Corona Corona Renderer is a modern photorealistic renderer that's available for Autodesk 3ds Max and Cinema 4D. It delivers physically plausible and predictable output due to its realistic lighting algorithm, global illumination, and beautiful materials. Corona does not support GPU rendering, so CPU performance is very important for all its users. We do not use the horribly outdated Corona Benchmark tool, which doesn't support new architectures, instead using the latest version, 8.2. Rendering — KeyShot The standalone KeyShot rendering software features fast and efficient workflows that help you get realistic high-quality product shots in the shortest possible time frame. Real-time ray tracing, multi-core photon mapping, adaptive material sampling, and a dynamic lighting core provide high-quality images that update instantly even when interactively working on the scene. KeyShot 11 is optimized for usage on both CPUs and GPUs. We use the CPU renderer because the GPU renderer still has some limitations in terms of rendering capability. Rendering — V-Ray V-Ray is a world-leading 3D rendering software that uses global illumination, path tracing, photon mapping, and irradiance maps to achieve super-realistic render output. It has been used for CG in countless motion pictures and television series. V-Ray supports all major 3D applications, which makes it a great fit for any rendering pipeline. In this test, we're using the V-Ray 5 benchmark tool in CPU-only mode to get the number of ""vsamples"" that can be processed on a given hardware. Higher is better. Game Development — Unreal Engine 5 Unreal Engine 5 is the leading multi-platform game engine in the industry. Not only advanced, it also has lots of features to help you get results quicker than with competing products—time is money. The latest version 5 adds several new features that make the engine not only suitable for gaming, but also for architecture, automotive and movie production. Before a game is shipped, there is a lengthy process called ""build, cook and package"", which optimizes the various assets, compiling and compressing them into versions that will work best on the target platform, before packaging them into optimized bundles ready for distribution. We use a relatively simple scene—usually this process takes several hours. Software Development — Visual Studio C++ Microsoft Visual C++ is probably the most popular programming language for creating professional Windows applications. It's part of Microsoft's Visual Studio development suite, which has a long history and is widely accepted as the gold standard when it comes to IDEs. Compiling software is a relatively lengthy process that turns program code into the final executable, and programmers hate waiting for it to complete. We run a medium-sized application through the Visual Studio 2022 C++ compiler and linker, and use the resource compiler, too. The build is executed in ""release"" mode with all optimizations turned on and multi-processor compilation enabled. Web Browsing — JetStream 2 The JetStream 2 browser benchmark combines multiple JavaScript and WebAssembly benchmarks with several advanced workloads to determine how quickly a browser can complete specific tasks. It not only rewards high overall performance, but also fast startup and consistent operation. Web Browsing — Speedometer 2 Speedometer 2 tests a ""to-do list"" web application that's implemented using a huge number of popular frameworks. Among the benchmarks are versions built with React, Ember.js, AngularJS, vue.js, jQuery and others—frameworks that are used by the most popular sites in the world. Web Browsing — WebXPRT WebXPRT 4 is a browser benchmark that measures the performance of typical web applications, like photo enhancement, media management using AI, stock option pricing, encryption, OCR, charting, and productivity. It contains HTML5, JavaScript, and WebAssembly-based scenarios to mirror typical every day workloads. Machine Learning — Image Upscaling Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have enabled us to create applications that are almost magical in their abilities. In our first AI benchmark, we use Topaz Gigapixel AI to upscale a series of low resolution photos to higher resolution, while improving fine details at the same time. Machine Learning — Image Classification Teaching an AI to accurately recognize the contents of an image has always been one of the holy grails of Machine Learning research. Nero AI Photo Tagger is a consumer-oriented application that implements a simple way to use these algorithms. We let the software classify 5000 photos with tags like ""car,"" ""dog,"" or ""flower."" Machine Learning — Tensorflow Building an AI to solve complex problems first requires it to be trained through a large training data set that is evaluated repeatedly to generate a neural network that can later be put to work (also called inference). Google's Python-based Tensorflow is one of the most popular machine-learning software packages that supports both CPUs and GPUs. Setting up Tensorflow for the GPU is complicated, so lots of algorithm development and training on small data sets still happens on the CPU. Training performance on the CPU can also beat the GPU when problem sizes exceed typical GPU memory capacities. Physics Simulation COMSOL is the gold standard for the accurate simulation of physics effects and one of the strongest competitors to Ansys. Where the software shines is in solving multiphysics problems that depend on several phenomena—you can simulate everything, including black holes. The modular aspect of COMSOL helps professionals customize the software to their desires, which can be run with a single module or a whole multitude of collaborating modules for more demanding tasks, as well as with two-way communication with external programs, such as CAD software. Chemistry Simulation NAMD is developed by the University of Illinois and helps researchers simulate the dynamic interactions between molecules and atoms. It is an established means of molecular dynamics simulation that scales from individual clusters of molecules to full-on chemical interaction in different phases. Parallel simulation modes help differentiate NAMD from its peers, allowing efficient problem solving of larger systems using the Charm++ parallel programming model as the base. Medical Science — Genome Analysis COVID-19 has shown the world that deadly pandemics can bring society to a standstill. Computational genomics is essential for rapid development of vaccine candidates in a race against time. In this test we're running an analysis on a set of genomes to determine which individuals in the dataset share common traits in their DNA. This is not only a compute-intensive workload, but it also uses quite a lot of memory (over 10 GB), which makes it dependent on the performance of the memory subsystem. Microsoft Office Microsoft's Office suite needs no introduction as it's probably the most widely used PC software on the planet, installed on every office computer no matter the industry. Our tests cover a wide range of editing and creation tasks in Word, PowerPoint, Excel and Outlook. Image Editing — Adobe Photoshop Adobe Photoshop has become the industry standard for photo and image processing. We run the latest Photoshop CC through a battery of typical editing tasks, like image resize, various blurs, sharpening, color and light adjustments, and image export. We also apply more complex actions like content-aware fill, lens correction, smart sharpen, select subject, and tilt shift. Video Editing — Adobe Premiere Pro Adobe Premiere Pro CC is the workhorse of the video production industry for creating high-quality content for film, TV, and the web. It can handle pretty much every recorded file format and supports workflows for editing Full HD, 4K, 8K, and virtual reality content. Unfortunately, most of Premiere Pro is single-threaded, and media encoding is highly GPU accelerated, so benchmarking ""export"" on the CPU makes little sense. For our testing, we're using the software's ""object tracking"" functionality, which automatically scans through a video to follow a specific person or object—this task does indeed use more than a single core, but doesn't fully scale. A lot of memory is consumed and accessed in the process, over 10 GB for our test scene. Video Production — Adobe After Effects While Premiere Pro is optimized for cutting, arranging and editing videos, Adobe After Effects is the industry standard for creating motion graphics, text rendering, color correction and other visual effects like outlines, explosions etc. When applied, each of these takes up a little bit of CPU time, so when there's many of them, processing duration will increase quite a bit. We're measuring the time it takes to export a short intro trailer, including music and sound. Create 3D Model from Photos Creating 3D models is a tedious and complex task that takes time and requires experienced artists. It's thus the holy grail of 3D modeling to reconstruct a 3D model from just a series of photos. That's exactly what Photogrammetry does. This method is also used to reconstruct terrain geometry from photos taken by aerial drones. Antivirus Scan Securing your system against viruses and malware is essential for reliable operation. Antivirus software detects unwanted programs by comparing files to a large database with thousands of signatures and rules. In this test we're measuring how long it takes to scan all files of a 30 GB game. Altium PCB Designer Altium Designer has been used to make at least one of the circuit boards inside your favorite piece of electronics. It's an industry-leading solution to build complex PCBs by automating circuit paths and ensuring that signal integrity and design rules are followed in the design. Our test measures how long it takes for Altium PCB Designer to load a project, run various operations on it, including autorouting, design rule check and finally releasing the whole design to manufacturing. Text Recognition OCR — Google Tesseract Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is the task of turning text in scanned images or photos into actual characters for archival, further processing, or editing. While most OCR software is single-threaded, Google's Tesseract engine can operate on multiple pages of a scanned document at once, spreading the load over several processor cores. The software, which is considered one of the most accurate open-source OCR packages available, automatically runs a spellcheck on the initial recognition results, which adds to the complexity of the workload.Reviewers Liked Stunning performance Can be used with a budget DDR4 motherboard Cheaper 600-series platform available Integrated graphics Support for PCI-Express 5.0 Reviewers Didn't Like Overclocking doesn't add as much extra performance as we hoped Power draw looks more like Core i7 than Core i5 Hotter and hungrier than the Core i5 12600K CPU cooler not included"
5,Ryzen 5 5600x,"Introduction The big AMD ""Zen 3"" architecture we've been hearing a lot about is finally here, and we have with us its most affordable part, the 6-core Ryzen 5 5600X. AMD claims that the 5600X is everything an AAA gamer would possibly want, and that the processor shouldn't get in the way of even premium 4K graphics cards. With the ""Zen 3"" launch, AMD is keeping its promise of rolling out a new microarchitecture every year since the 2017 debut of the original ""Zen."" What's astonishing, though, is that AMD has managed to deliver an IPC increase with each microarchitecture launched since. In contrast, Intel has been stuck with the same IPC for the desktop platform for half a decade, and its ""Rocket Lake"" processor reportedly won't launch until March 2021. The ""Zen 3"" microarchitecture heralds a significant 19% IPC increase over ""Zen 2,"" which already had a transformative impact on the desktop processor market. Higher IPC means higher single-threaded performance, which means games, traditionally less parallelized than productivity, tend to benefit more. An IPC increase of the kind being marketed by AMD would mean that ""Zen 3"" beats Intel at gaming given ""Zen 2"" wasn't too far behind ""Comet Lake"" for gaming. At the higher-end, with the Ryzen 9 series, AMD offers more cores to the dollar with 12-core and 16-core parts, but things are evenly matched between the Ryzen 5 5600X and Intel Core i5-10600K, with both being 6-core/12-thread parts. The biggest under-the-hood change with ""Zen 3"" is AMD practically doing away with the 4-core CCX by putting all eight cores of its chiplet into a single 8-core CCX. This means all cores within a chiplet can talk to each other at lower latency, and access a larger 32 MB shared L3 cache. The 5600X is carved out by disabling two out of eight cores. AMD's Ryzen 5000 processors still implement a multi-chip module, with this generation's MCM being codenamed ""Vermeer."" AMD is debuting the Ryzen 5 5600X at a staggering $299, which is the highest launch price ever for a Ryzen 5-series processor, higher than what you'd pay for an 8-core 3700X. AMD states that the 5600X should have everything you need to build a gaming desktop for any resolution. Unlike the 5800X and 5900X which lack stock cooling solutions, AMD is including a cooler with the Ryzen 5. The chip has the same 95 W TDP as its predecessor, the 3600X, and is built on the same 7 nm silicon fabrication node. In this review, we put the Ryzen 5 5600X through our wide selection of gaming and productivity tests to tell you whether six ""Zen 3"" cores are worth more than eight ""Zen 2"" ones. Unboxing and Photography The Ryzen 5 5600X comes in a fairly large paperboard box. The front face of Ryzen 5000 series box features a brushed metal look (compared to the carbon fiber appearance of the Ryzen 3000 series). There are enough pointers to let you know you're buying a Ryzen 5000-series part. A small cutout on the side shows the actual processor inside the package. Unlike other Zen 3 processors launched today, the Ryzen 5 5600X includes a heatsink in the box. The Wraith Stealth cooling solution is suitable for the 65 W TDP of the Ryzen 5 5600X. The processor looks like any conventional AMD CPU with a large IHS dominating the top, and a 1,331-pin micro-PGA as the bottom. The ""Zen 3"" CCD chiplet is made in Taiwan and the I/O die in the US, and the two are put together at a facility in China. Architecture The Zen 3 Microarchitecture Since its 2017 debut, AMD has delivered a new iteration of its groundbreaking Zen CPU microarchitecture each year, each with IPC improvements. As we mentioned earlier, the new Zen 3 microarchitecture claims to offer a massive 19 percent IPC uplift over its predecessor, Zen 2. This is accomplished by improvements at both micro and macro levels. We already detailed the macro (beyond the core) changes above. In this section, we talk about what's new inside each core. AMD talks about updates to practically all key components of the core, including its front-end, fetch/decode, the integer and floating-point components, load-store, and the dedicated caches. Modern processors execute multiple instructions in parallel to improve performance. Computer programs consist of huge amounts of ""if ... then ... else"" instructions, which slow down the processor because it has to evaluate the condition before picking a branch to execute. In order to overcome this limitation, the branch predictor was invented, a piece of circuitry that takes a guess on what's the more likely outcome of the condition check and just speculatively executes that branch's instructions. Of course, there's a chance that the prediction is wrong, in which case a performance penalty is incurred from undoing the executions that were already executed. With ""Zen 3"", AMD uses an improved TAGE branch predictor, which is more accurate and recovers faster from mispredictions. They also changed the design to be ""bubble free,"" which avoids inserting ""wait for result"" instructions in the instruction stream whenever a branch is encountered. AMD generally increased ops/cycle; the front-end now switches between the op and instruction caches faster. The 32 KB L1 instruction cache has been tweaked to offer better utilization due to efficient tagging and pre-fetching. Streamlining was done to the Op cache. Improvements to the branch predictor and front-end add up to nearly a quarter of the overall 19% generational IPC uplift. The execution engine, or combination of the integer and floating-point execution units, is the main math muscle of the CPU core. The ""Zen 3"" microarchitecture features improvements to both over ""Zen 2."" Both the INT and FP issue queues (which feed work to the two engines) have been widened and the execution window enlarged. This ensures fewer units are idle in typical programs, which increases overall performance. AMD worked to minimize latencies at every stage of the INT execution engine, and enlarged its key structures, including the integer scheduler (96 entry vs. 92 on ""Zen 2""), physical register file (192 vs. 180 on ""Zen 2""), and 10 issues per cycle, up from 7 on ""Zen 2."" Data picker bandwidth has been significantly increased despite the same number of ALUs. The floating-point engine features the same 256-bit FPUs, but just as with the INT engine, the FP engine has latency and bandwidth improvements across the board, a faster 4-cycle FMAC, and a larger scheduler. The INT and FP improvements contribute around a fifth of the 19% overall IPC uplift. With the ""Zen 3"" microarchitecture, AMD addressed many bottlenecks and ""intelligence"" issues with the Load/Store unit. The biggest has to be bandwidth. The entry store queue has been widened to 64 from 48 on ""Zen 2,"" and the L2 cache DTLB is 2K entries wide. The 32 KB L1 data cache has been made faster, with lower latencies. Memory dependence detection has been improved. Much like the front-end and scheduler, the load/store improvements contribute nearly a quarter of the 19% overall IPC uplift, meaning that by just optimizing the non-execution components of its core, AMD managed to pull off a vast 9% overall IPC uplift. ISA and Security Changes Each new microarchitecture heralds support for newer instruction sets and security hardening, and the same is the case with ""Zen 3""; however, a notable absentee is AVX-512. Granted, Intel has adopted a less than perfect method of proliferating AVX-512 with certain instructions being exclusive to enterprise-segment microarchitectures and only a handful client-relevant instructions on its ""Ice Lake"" and ""Tiger Lake"" architectures, but there's no movement from AMD in this direction. You still do get 256-bit instructions from within the AVX2 set. Also missing in action is something to rival Intel's DLBoost, which is essentially a software exposure of fixed-function hardware that accelerates matrix multiplication, in effect AI deep-learning neural net building and training. A lot of client applications, particularly image manipulation and video editing, are leveraging edge AI, and some investment from AMD on this would have been nice. That said, ""Zen 3"" adds two new ISA instructions, MPK (memory protection keys) and AVX2 support for AES/APCLMulQD. AMD has been ahead of Intel with CPU core security vulnerability perception, and with ""Zen 3,"" AMD is introducing CET, or control-flow enforcement, which should provide hardening against ROP-type attacks. Vermeer Multi-Chip Module The AMD Ryzen 9 5600X ""Zen 3"" processor is built on a Socket AM4 multi-chip module package the company refers to as ""Vermeer."" Since the Ryzen 3000 ""Matisse,"" which was the first desktop processor to implement the 7 nm silicon fabrication process, AMD figured out a way to optimize the utilization of its 7 nm foundry allocation by using two things—building only those components that tangibly benefit from the new node on 7 nm, namely the CPU cores, and moving all other components to a separate die built on older 12 nm process, the cIOD (client IO die). The CPU cores are built on tiny dies with eight cores each, which AMD refers to as the CCD (CPU core die), and on the older ""Zen 2"" microarchitecture, the eight cores were split into two groups of four cores, each, called CPU core complexes (CCX). Each of the two CCX on the ""Zen 2"" CCD had its own 16-megabyte L3 cache shared between the two cores, and communication between cores of different CCX required a round-trip to the cIOD. With the new ""Zen 3"" microarchitecture, the biggest high-level change with the CCD is AMD's enlargement of the CCX to now include up to eight cores (essentially taking up the whole CCD). There's now one 8-core CCX per CCD. The biggest dividend of this change has to be improved inter-core latency since the eight cores now share the same L3 cache; the other big dividend has to be cache size. Each core on the CCD now has access to the full 32 MB L3 as a victim cache, so lightly threaded workloads should see a performance uplift. Eight-core Ryzen 7 5000-series models, such as the 5800X, feature a single CCD with all cores enabled. 6-core parts, such as the Ryzen 5 5600X, feature one CCD with any two of the cores disabled (shouldn't matter which ones). The 12-core Ryzen 9 5900X and 16-core Ryzen 9 5950X are parts that have two 8-core CCDs besides the cIOD. The 5900X is carved out by disabling any two cores per CCD, while the 5950X has all cores enabled on both CCDs. We confirmed with AMD that Ryzen 5000 ""Vermeer"" uses the same exact 12 nm cIOD as the Ryzen 3000 ""Matisse"" with only a couple of non-physical improvements, such as improved memory clocks and clock domains. Power Management and Overclocking Enhancements The new Ryzen 5000 ""Zen 3"" processors are even more independent from the OS than before when it comes to power management. The CPUs mostly rely on themselves in gauging processing load and responding with the appropriate performance budget. The ""Zen 3"" CPU core can operate at voltages ranging all the way from 0.2 V to 1.5 V (normal operation). The same Precision Boost 2 algorithm as the one on ""Zen 2"" Ryzen 3000 series processors is used. CPU clock speed boost, voltage adjustments, and clock-gated sleep changes occur at a 1 ms timescale (compared to the 15 ms tick-rate for OS-dictated power management). AMD has also enabled 0 V (power-gated) sleep, with the CPU cores being able to jump to power-gated sleep states without being ""disturbed"" by monitoring tools. Changes have been made to minimize the ""observer effect"" on CPU cores by monitoring tools. All Ryzen 5000 processors being launched today come with unlocked base-clock multipliers, making CPU overclocking a breeze. Memory overclocking is a whole different beast, and efforts have been made to make memory OC easier compared to past generations of ""Zen"" processors. Unlike on Intel processors, memory overclocking has a greater impact on performance for Ryzen processors as several other clock domains are tied to the memory clock (mclk), such as the all-important fclk domain, which dictates the frequency at which the Infinity Fabric interconnect operates. We've extensively covered memory overclocking for Ryzen in our definitive memory overclocking guide . Given that ""Vermeer"" uses the same cIOD as ""Matisse,"" the memory controllers are largely unchanged. What's new, however, is that certain Ryzen 5000 series processor models can support DDR4-4000 in the 1:1 fclk:mclk ratio without having to engage a 1:2 divider. AMD explained that this is comparable to ""some Zen 2 processors can run at 1800 MHz IF, some cannot"". AMD X570 and B550 Chipsets At launch, Ryzen 5000 ""Zen 3"" processors should be compatible with all Socket AM4 motherboards based on AMD X570 and B550 chipsets, with a BIOS update that has the latest AGESA ComboPI 1.1.0.0 micro-code. The BIOS update must be installed before installing the Zen 3 CPU. Trying to boot the old BIOS with a Zen 3 will not work (we've tried). Luckily, most Socket AM4 motherboards feature some form of USB BIOS Flashback feature that lets you update the motherboard BIOS without having to install a processor or memory, which means you won't have to borrow an older processor just to update your motherboard's BIOS. Recent batches of AMD 500-series chipset motherboards should ship with Ryzen 5000 series support out of the box. The AMD X570 chipset is a premium offering that enables PCI-Express gen 4.0 not just from the processor (i.e., the main x16 PEG slot and one M.2 NVMe slot), but also downstream PCIe lanes attached to the chipset. You get up to 16 PCIe gen 4 lanes from the chipset, which can be re-configured as SATA or USB3 ports by the motherboard designer. The B550 chipset lets you have one PCIe gen 4 main x16 slot and one M.2 NVMe slot, but all chipset-attached downstream lanes are PCIe gen 3. The B550 puts out eight downstream lanes. AMD is expected to release a special version of AGESA that enables Ryzen 5000 ""Zen 3"" support for AMD 400-series chipset motherboards. However, this BIOS update will come with certain riders (e.g., you lose support for older processors). Motherboard vendors are expected to roll out BIOS updates for their 400-series chipset motherboards starting January 2021. Test Setup All applications, games, and processors are tested with the drivers and hardware listed below—no performance results were recycled between test systems. All games and applications are tested using the same version. All games are set to their highest quality setting unless indicated otherwise.

It has been used in world-record competitions since forever. It is a purely single-threaded CPU test that calculates Pi to a large number of digits—32 million for our testing. Released in 1995, it only supports x86 floating-point instructions and thus makes for a good test for single-threaded legacy application performance. wPrime While SuperPi focuses on calculating Pi, wPrime tackles another mathematical problem: finding prime numbers. It uses Newton's Method for that. One of the design goals for wPrime was to engineer it so that it can make the best use of all cores and threads available on a processor. Rendering — Cinebench Cinebench is one of the most popular modern CPU benchmarks because it is built around the renderer of Maxon's Cinema 4D software. Both AMD and Intel have been showing this performance test at various public events, making it almost an industry standard. Using Cinebench R20, we test both single-threaded and multi-threaded performance. Rendering — Blender Blender is one of the few professional-grade rendering programs out there that is both free and open source. That fact alone helped build a strong community around the software, making it a highly popular benchmark program due to its ease of use as well. For our testing, we're using the Blender ""BMW 27"" benchmark scene. Rendering — Corona Corona Renderer is a modern photorealistic renderer that's available for Autodesk 3ds Max and Cinema 4D. It delivers physically plausible and predictable output due to its realistic lighting algorithm, global illumination, and beautiful materials. Corona does not support GPU rendering, so CPU performance is very important for all its users. Rendering — KeyShot The standalone KeyShot rendering software features fast and efficient workflows that help you get realistic high-quality product shots in the shortest possible time frame. Real-time raytracing, multi-core photon mapping, adaptive material sampling, and a dynamic lighting core provide high-quality images that update instantly even when interactively working on the scene. KeyShot is optimized for usage on CPUs only, which lets them use more complex algorithms than a GPU-based renderer. Unlike our other rendering tests, we record ""frames per second"" in KeyShot while rendering, so higher numbers are better. Game Development — Unreal Engine 4 Unreal Engine 4 is one of the leading multi-platform game engines in the industry. Not only advanced, it also has lots of features to help you get results quicker than with competing products—time is money. Before a game is shipped, the lengthy process of ""light baking"" has to be executed. It takes all static geometry and fixed light sources in the scene and precalculates lightmap textures for them, which results in a tremendous performance speed boost of the final game because these calculations no longer have to be performed in real time on the user's system. For our benchmarks, we generate baked light maps for a relatively simple scene, which usually takes several hours. Software Development — Visual Studio C++ Microsoft Visual C++ is probably the most popular programming language for creating professional Windows applications. It's part of Microsoft's Visual Studio development suite, which has a long history and is widely accepted as the gold standard when it comes to IDEs. Compiling software is a relatively lengthy process that turns program code into the final executable, and programmers hate waiting for it to complete. We run a medium-sized application through the C++ compiler and linker, and execute the resource compiler, too. The build is executed in ""release"" mode with all optimizations turned on and multi-processor compilation enabled. Web Browsing — Google Octane Google Octane tests web browser performance by running a suite of Javascript-based tests that represent typical use cases in today's dynamic, interactive web applications. Web Browsing — Mozilla Kraken Mozilla Kraken is similar to Octane in that it measures the execution time of Javascript, but uses a different set of tests based on the SunSpider benchmark. Test cases include audio processing, search algorithms, image filtering, JSON parsing, and cryptography. Web Browsing — WebXPRT WebXPRT 3 is a browser benchmark that measures the performance of typical web applications, like photo enhancement, media management using AI, stock option pricing, encryption, OCR, charting, and productivity. This is in contrast to our other two browser benchmarks which focus more on microbenchmarks, testing specific algorithms. Machine Learning — Tensorflow Artificial Intelligence is everywhere these days. Machine-learning-based algorithms are taking the grunt work out of many manual tasks that could previously only be performed by humans. In order for Deep Learning AI to solve problems, it has to be trained first through a large set of training data that is evaluated repeatedly to generate a neural network that can later be put to work (also called inference). Google's Python-based Tensorflow is one of the most popular machine-learning software packages that supports both CPUs and GPUs. Setting up Tensorflow for the GPU is a bit complicated, so lots of algorithm development and training on small data sets still happens on the CPU. Training performance on the CPU can also beat the GPU when problem sizes exceed typical GPU memory capacities. Physics Simulation Engineering widely uses the finite element method (FEM), which is able to simulate the flow of liquid (CFD), heat transfer, and structural stability to verify whether a final product is able to meet design requirements. Solving such a problem breaks the system up into a large number of simple parts called finite elements that are all able to interact with each other. This is a highly complex mathematical task that requires a lot of processing power, which is very difficult to parallelize on GPUs. Our Euler3D benchmark test is fully parallelized to make the most of multiple CPU cores, but it also puts a lot of stress on the memory subsystem. Brain Neuron Simulation In order to better understand how brains work, biology and medical research uses software to simulate neurons and their interactions with each other. Scientists hope that this can ultimately lead to an understanding of how biological intelligence emerges. Just like our physics simulation test, this is a highly complex, memory intensive problem that is best solved on CPUs—GPUs aren't well suited to these algorithms. Microsoft Office Microsoft's Office suite needs no introduction as it's probably the most widely used PC software on the planet, installed on every office computer no matter the industry. Our tests cover a wide range of editing and creation tasks in Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. Image Editing — Adobe Photoshop Adobe Photoshop has become the industry standard for photo and image processing. We run the latest Photoshop CC through a battery of typical editing tasks, like image resize, various blurs, sharpening, color and light adjustments, and image export. Video Editing — Adobe Premiere Pro Adobe Premiere Pro CC is the workhorse of the video production industry when it comes to creating high-quality content for film, TV, and the web. It can handle pretty much every recorded file format and supports workflows for editing Full HD, 4K, 8K, and virtual reality content. Unfortunately, most of Premiere Pro is single-threaded, and media encoding is highly GPU accelerated, so benchmarking ""export"" on the CPU makes little sense. For our testing, we're using the software's ""object tracking"" functionality, which automatically scans through a video to follow a specific person or object—this task does indeed use more than a core, but doesn't fully scale. A lot of memory is consumed and accessed in the process (over 10 GB for our test scene). Create 3D Model from Photos Creating 3D models is a tedious and complex task that takes time and requires experienced artists. It's thus the holy grail of 3D modeling to reconstruct a 3D model from just a series of photos. That's exactly what Photogrammetry does. This method is also used to reconstruct terrain geometry from photos taken by aerial drones. Text Recognition OCR — Google Tesseract Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is the task of turning text in scanned images or photos into actual characters for archival, further processing, or editing. While most OCR software is single-threaded, Google's Tesseract engine can operate on multiple pages of a scanned document at once, spreading the load over several processor cores. The software, which is considered one of the most accurate open-source OCR packages available, automatically runs a spellcheck on the initial recognition results, which adds to the complexity of the workload. Virtualization — VMWare Workstation A virtual machine is a simulated computer inside your computer that's completely independent of the host PC. This not only improves security, but also enables software written for different operating systems to execute on one physical machine. Virtualization is the foundation for ""the cloud"" and helps reduce hardware ownership cost by dynamically spreading out virtual machines over multiple computers to make best use of given hardware resources. We're testing VM performance using VMWare Workstation, with hardware virtualization support enabled for both Intel and AMD processors. Curiously, many AMD Ryzen motherboards ship with the ""SVM"" setting disabled by default, so we made absolutely certain we had enabled it. Database — MySQL More data is stored and processed today than ever before in human history. The backbone for this revolution are database systems that manage storage and retrieval throughout large data sets. Whenever you interact with a website or other digital service, it's almost guaranteed that at least one database is involved in returning the results you are looking for. We benchmark the most popular database system, MySQL, in the TPC-C test, which simulates a large number of warehouses and their constantly changing inventory. The number reported is ""transactions per second"", so higher is better. Java The Java programming language is designed to be platform independent, highly scalable, and fault tolerant, which is why it's very popular for enterprise services that work with large amounts of data and many concurrent users. Our test suite consists of a large mix of individual Java benchmarks, some of them single-threaded, some that scale somewhat, and some that fully scale to as many cores as are available. Compression — WinRAR Data is compressed almost all the time when it moves over the wire to reduce download time and transfer sizes. WinRAR uses a more advanced compression algorithm than classic ZIP, which is why we chose it for this test. It's also able to scale across multiple processor cores. Compression — 7-Zip Another popular compression software is 7-Zip, which includes a benchmark that measures the integer instruction rate (MIPS) using the ZIP algorithm. It makes good use of multiple threads, when available. Encryption — VeraCrypt Encryption is the cornerstone for today's security on the Internet, ensuring not everybody can see your data as it travels through various routers on the way to its final destination. VeraCrypt, which is based on the disk-encryption software TrueCrypt, enables open-source encryption for your disk drives without any backdoors. The application comes with a multi-threaded performance test that measures the rate at which data can be encrypted. We are using the AES algorithm for our testing. Media Encoding — H.265 / HEVC Nowadays, all video that is consumed, whether on TV, physical media, or streamed over the Internet, is compressed using various codecs. Our first video-encoding test uses the fairly new H.265 codec, which is also known as HEVC. We compress a full HD video using the latest version of the X265 encoder, with 8-bit color depth, preset ""slow"", and a quality setting of crf 20. Media Encoding — H.264 / AVC H.264, also called AVC, is a slightly older compression format, though probably the most widely used compression format these days because it is well supported in even older hardware. We compress the same video as in the H.265 test using the X264 encoding software, with preset ""slower"" and crf 20. Media Encoding — MP3 MP3 revolutionized the music industry like no other technology. Introduced in the 90s, it enabled massive reduction in audio-file sizes without noticeable impact on sound quality. This made music downloads, and ultimately streaming, a feasible method of content delivery over the Internet. For our benchmark, we convert a 2.5 hour-long 44.1 kHz Stereo recording to a variable bitrate MP3 file. MP3 encoding is a single-threaded process. Game Tests: 720p On popular demand from comments over the past several CPU reviews, we are including game tests at 720p (1280x720 pixels) resolution. All games from our CPU test suite are put through 720p using a RTX 2080 Ti graphics card and Ultra settings. This low resolution serves to highlight theoretical CPU performance because games are extremely CPU-limited at this resolution. Of course, nobody buys a PC with an RTX 2080 Ti to game at 720p, but the results are of academic value because a CPU that can't do 144 frames per second at 720p will never reach that mark at higher resolutions. So, these numbers could interest high-refresh-rate gaming PC builders with fast 120 Hz and 144 Hz monitors. Our 720p tests hence serve as synthetic tests in that they are not real world (720p isn't a real-world PC-gaming resolution anymore) even though the game tests themselves are not synthetic (they're real games, not 3D benchmarks). Individual Benchmark Scores Game Tests 1080p Individual Benchmark Scores Game Tests 1440p Individual Benchmark Scores Game Tests 4K Individual Benchmark Scores Power Consumption Energy Efficiency In this section, we measure the total amount of energy consumed for a SuperPi run (single-threaded) and Cinebench (multi-threaded). Since a faster processor will complete a given workload quicker, the total amount of energy used might end up less than on a low-powered processor, which might draw less power, but will take longer to finish the test. Temperatures We used a Noctua NH-U14S to measure the CPU temperature while running Blender. We picked an actual application as that better reflects real-life usage than a stress-testing application like Prime95. The chart has a typo, we used NH-U14S, not NH-U12S Clock Frequencies The following chart shows how well the processor sustains its clock frequency, and which boost clock speeds are achieved at various thread counts. This test uses a custom-coded application that mimics real-life performance—it is not a stress test like Prime95. Modern processors change their clocking behavior depending on the type of load, which is why we provide three plots with classic floating point math, SSE SIMD code, and the modern AVX vector instructions. Each of the three test runs calculates the same result using the same algorithm, just with a different CPU instruction set. Overclocking For overclocking, I set a fixed voltage of 1.4 V and started increasing clocks, while checking stability at the same time. This is extremely easy due to AMD Ryzen Master, which has come a long way and is now top-notch. My highest all-core maximum stable overclock using an air cooler was 4.6 GHz. Actually, I could run nearly everything with 4.7 GHz, except for some AVX tests, which weren't stable unless I went over 1.45 V. Once I settled with a 4.6 GHz OC, I could lower the voltage to 1.35 V, which is quite a bit, with the CPU completely stable. Using a 240 mm AIO made no difference for overclocking, Performance Summary Performance per Dollar Value and Conclusion The AMD Ryzen 5 5600X will retail for $299. Beats 8-core 3800XT in both compute and gaming Huge IPC gains Gaming performance improved by over 15% Impressive application performance Compatible with existing AM4 motherboards Multiplier unlocked Power efficiency improved Support for PCI-Express Gen 4 Cooler included 7 nanometer production process Price increase over previous generation Overclocking barely worth it No integrated graphics The AMD Ryzen 5 5600X is arguably the most exciting processor launched today. Granted, it comes in at a steep price of $300, but just look at what you're getting. Many years ago, naysayers had talked about AMD just grabbing the low-hanging fruit, and that these gains would soon be history as Zen would be a one-hit pony with the departure of its lead designer. Boy, were they wrong. We have a total of three Zen 3 reviews for you today: Ryzen 9 5900X , Ryzen 7 5800X , Ryzen 5 5600X . Our fourth review, of the Ryzen 9 5950X, is half-finished and will be posted soon. The Ryzen 5 5600X is a 6-core/12-thread processor. With Intel having maxed out its core/thread counts with the 10th Gen ""Comet Lake,"" skeptics would have guessed AMD would dial up core-counts by offering eight cores for the Ryzen 5 series. AMD had other plans. The ""Zen 3"" architecture is a work of art as much as it is an engineering feat. The company managed to squeeze a massive IPC gain out of the same 7 nm process node without fundamentally changing core counts and simply improving the inner workings on the CPU cores. They also improved the multi-core topology by essentially doing away with the arbitrary 4-cores per CCX limitation. In their presentations and launch event, AMD has been marketing the Ryzen 5 5600X as the best CPU for ""strictly-gaming"" builds, but our results show it to be a lot more—six ""Zen 3"" cores beat eight ""Zen 2"" cores at productivity, with the 5600X beating the recently launched 3800XT, the top 8-core part from the previous generation. The 5600X is consistently ahead of the entire Ryzen 3000 series—including the 3900X—posting 720p performance higher than the Core i7-10700K. 720p game tests highlight CPU-level bottlenecks and are a good measure of IPC, which is relevant to gamers. With 1080p gaming, the 5600X is about 4.5% faster than the 3900X and about as fast as an i9-9900K. The i5-10600K is about 0.9% ahead. As we go higher up the resolution ladder, the performance bottleneck shifts toward the GPU. The 5600X is 2% slower than the i9-10900K and 2.5% faster than the 3600X. 4K remains a toss-up, with the 5600X performing within 1.2% of the i9-10900K. Needless to say, Intel's gaming performance lead is basically irrelevant now, as AMD has caught up, and the odd-percent here isn't worth worrying about and within random variation. General compute is where the real story of the 5600X takes place. Despite two fewer cores than the Ryzen 7 3800X, the 5600X ends up consistently faster in CPU tests, except in rendering tests that scale across cores, but also real-world tests that benefit from fewer but faster cores. In fact, in web-rendering tests, the 5600X ends up beating all Intel chips, including the i9-10900K. In certain tests that scale well with multi-core and also benefit from high IPC, such as physics simulation, the 5600X springs a surprise as it beats the 3800XT and is only slightly behind the i9-9900K. The 5600X is also a potent office warrior, beating every Intel processor in our bench, including the i9-10900K. A recurring trend with many of our CPU tests that don't need too many cores shows that the 5800X is often the only chip that ends up faster than the 5600X, possibly because the dual CCD layout of the 5900X inhibits some performance. Even with my current results, the Intel gaming advantage is effectively gone, a percent here or there really isn't worth worrying about, especially when you consider the application performance and platform improvements. While Intel wants you to buy a new motherboard every time a new processor generation is released, AMD has given us a solid upgrade path with AM4. If you own an AMD AM4 motherboard with 400 or 500-series chipset, upgrading to Zen 3 is really just ""BIOS update, remove heatsink, plop in new CPU, install heatsink, done"". As mentioned before, AMD made sure not to increase power requirements, so your cooler, power supply, and everything else will continue to be work just fine. We tested overclocking on the 5600X and achieved an all-core overclock of 4.60 GHz. This means that unless you are running highly threaded applications all day that fully load all cores on your processor, you'll be better off without overclocking. It also helps keep power draw and temperatures low. It's still nice to see an unlocked multiplier on Ryzen processors. Intel charges you extra for this. AMD not only engineered a new, faster architecture, they also improved power efficiency without a node shrink. The Zen 3 processors are produced on the same 7 nm process at TSMC, just like their Zen 2 brothers; the IO die is even 100% identical. AMD has still achieved significant power savings. We measured about 15 W lower power draw in multi-threaded workloads with higher performance. Power is an absolute mind-bender. Load power consumption is roughly the same as the previous-generation 3600X, but with the added 16% performance. Kudos, AMD! We have mentioned the lack of an integrated GPU in all Ryzen reviews and received a lot of criticism for just mentioning that fact. It's still true, and not a big deal at all, but Intel offers an iGPU that is sufficient for basic tasks and minimal gaming. Yes, I know that AMD has their APU line of products, but given the modular design of the Ryzen processors, I wonder how expensive it could be to design a very basic GPU die connected via Infinity Fabric to strengthen the Ryzen position in non-gaming market segments, where every dollar counts. AMD is asking $300 for their Ryzen 5 5600X, which matches the current price of the 3800X and i7-10700 non-K. Last-generation's Ryzen 9 3600X launched for $240, so AMD has increased prices by 25%, which is not surprising of any company once they a leading product. Also, I suspect supply of Zen 3 will be constrained in the first months, so a higher price will only improve AMD's margins, which is required to support their current stock price. Taking a closer look at performance per dollar, I get the feeling AMD decided to price Zen 3 based on the performance gained, not the product name or typical positioning. It's nice to see a heatsink included with the package, as a large portion of the user base will use the processor at stock settings, which makes the included Wraith Stealth a perfectly capable choice. In conclusion, the Ryzen 5 5600X is a pocket-rocket and will impress you in ways you can't imagine. It punches way above its weight in most tests and is the only processor you'll need if you're building a next-gen build with a fairly expensive RTX 30-series or RX 6000 series graphics card. The $300 price tag is a little high, but consider the trade off—you get much higher single-thread performance than any previous-gen Ryzen, and the productivity performance beats last generation's eight-core processors. Boy, what a turn around. Our awards explainedIt's time we finally check out the Ryzen 5 5600X, the most affordable Ryzen 5000 series processor announced to date. Positioned as a mainstream part, it's coming in at $300, a 20% premium over the Ryzen 5 3600X. However this third-gen processor already didn't make sense as it cost 25% more than the R5 3600 and offered little extra performance. Therefore, most opted for the $200 Ryzen 5 3600 , which is what we widely recommended in the past year as the best value CPU, and that's the part we'll be comparing the 5600X to today. Though we're sure AMD would have preferred we use the 3600X or 3600XT , we'll stick to the more popular vanilla 3600. As a side note, the rumor mill has been churning out reports of a Ryzen 5 5600, a non-X version which might arrive at around $220, just 10% more than the beloved 3600. But we won't know until we know. In the meantime, we've got a somewhat pricey 6-core, 12-thread Ryzen 5600X to check out and we're very keen to see how it compares to not just the Ryzen 5 3600, but also the Ryzen 7 3700X , and how it stacks up against Intel's Core i5-10600K . The 5600X features a single CCD with 6 cores enabled, which means it's limited to a 32MB L3 cache. This is still substantial compared to Intel parts, but it's half of what you get with the 5900X , as that higher-end processor packs two CCDs with 6 cores enabled. The 5600X features a 3.7 GHz base clock with a 4.6 GHz boost clock, very similar clock frequencies to the 8-core 5800X . Ryzen 9 5950X Ryzen 9 5900X Ryzen 7 5800X Ryzen 5 5600X Price $799 $549 $449 $299 Cores / Threads 16/32 12/24 8/16 6/12 Base clock (GHz) 3.4 3.7 3.8 3.7 Boost clock (GHz) 4.9 4.8 4.7 4.6 L2 + L3 Cache 72MB 70MB 36MB 35MB TDP 105W 105W 105W 65W Now it's time to test and then we'll re-evaluate the value of the 5800X towards the end of the review. For testing the AMD CPUs we used the MSI X570 Godlike motherboard along with four 8GB G.Skill TridentZ DDR4-3200 CL14 memory modules for a 32GB capacity. All cooling was handled by the Corsair iCUE H150i Elite Capellix AIO. As we've done with all reviews in this Ryzen 5000 series, all productivity benchmarks were run using the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, but for the gaming tests we upgraded to the more powerful RTX 3090 . Benchmarks Starting with Cinebench R20's multi-core test , we see that the Ryzen 5 5600X is good for 4462 pts or 19% faster than the 3600 and 24% faster than Core i5-10600K. Compared to existing 6-core, 12-thread processors, the performance uplift provided by the 5600X is substantial, so much so that we're very close to 8-core CPU performance. For example, the 5600X is just 9% slower than the Ryzen 7 3700X and 10% slower than the Core i7-10700K , that's a phenomenal result given it packs 25% fewer cores. Given the strong multi-core performance, you won't be surprised to learn that the 5600X is very fast when it comes to single core performance. Here we're looking at a 23% improvement from the 3600 and 18% from the 3700X. In fact, when it comes to single-thread performance the 5600X is faster than even the Core i9-10900K. In terms of clock speeds, we monitored how the 5600X clocks in each of the Cinebench R20 tests. For the multi-core test, where all cores are heavily loaded, the 5600X clocked at around 4.4 GHz, which is well above the advertised 3.7 GHz base clock frequency. AMD also advertises a max boost clock frequency of 4.6 GHz and this should be achieved in single core or lightly threaded workloads. In the Cinebench single core test the 5600X typically operated at 4.65 GHz, that's 50 MHz over the advertised spec. Next up we have 7-zip compression performance and here the 5600X was able to match the 3700X and 10700K, which is a great result and it translates into a 30% performance uplift over the current 6-core/12-thread processors such as the Ryzen 5 3600 and Core i5-10600K. Decompression performance was just as good. Here the 5600X was 7% slower than the 3700X, but 22% faster than the 3600 and a whopping 41% faster than the 10600K. The cryptographic performance of the 5600X is very strong, beating even the 10900K for AES for encryption/decryption. It was 4% slower than the 3700X and 11% faster than the 3600. The performance improvement in Blender is what we've come to expect: we're looking at a 19% uplift over the 3600, making the 5600X 15% slower than the 3700X, which is the biggest margin we've seen yet to the 8-core processor, but even so still an impressive result given it features 25% fewer cores. Once again we see that Zen 3 is a beast in V-Ray as the 5600X comes in just behind the 3700X, losing by a mere 4% and that meant it was 30% faster than the 3600 and 25% faster than the Core i5-10600K. The last rendering benchmark we're going to look at is Corona , and again we find more evidence of the 5600X destroying the 3600, this time by a 28% margin. At that rate, the 5600X was just 6% slower than the 3700X, finding itself situated between the 2nd and 3rd gen 8-core processors. Code compilation performance has been improved by 8% over the 3600. The 5600X was 12% slower than the 3700X here, which is one of it's biggest losses to the older 8-core processor. We're looking at a 6% performance improvement in DaVinci Resolve Studio 16 , so not nearly as impressive as some of the other applications we've tested, but still better than a typical gen on gen improvement. The Premiere Pro results are slightly more favorable for the new 6-core Zen 3 processor as here it was 10% faster than the 3600 and just 3% slower than the 3700X and 10700K. Here we're looking at comparable performance to existing 8-core AMD and Intel processors. The single thread performance of Zen 3 has been massively improved, and we're getting a good look at what that means for single threaded applications like Photoshop. The 5600X was 22% faster that the R5 3600, and 18% faster than the 3700X and 10600K, so that's a huge performance improvement. After Effects is another application that replies predominantly on single core performance and here we see solid performance from the 5600X. At 21% faster than the 3600 and 15% faster than the 3700X, it also easily beat Intel's Core i5-10600K and Core i7-10700K, hell it even beat the 10900K! Power Consumption Like the rest of the Zen 3 range, the Ryzen 5 5600X is exceptionally good in terms of power consumption. We're looking at a 7 watt increase from the 3600, which is excellent considering it's 19% faster in the Blender benchmark. The new CPU also reduced total system consumption by 14% when compared to the 3700X, though that's in line with the performance deficit to that part. When compared to competing Intel parts such as the 10600K, we're looking at massively improved power efficiency. As for operating temperatures, the Ryzen 5 5600X is a very cool running CPU. Peaking at just 63C in our Blender stress test means it's 10C cooler than the 3600X, which is impressive given the similar voltage but almost 500 MHz increase in average clock speed. Gaming Performance Testing with Far Cry New Dawn, we see that the Ryzen 5 5600X is 18% faster than the 3600 and 16% faster than the 3700X. That's a serious performance gain over previous-gen parts. It was also 7% faster than the 10600K and offered better frame time performance. The 5600X also just edged out the 5950X and 5900X as this title doesn't heavily utilize those parts and the lower latency, single CCD design is likely playing a role here. Though we're talking about a negligible 1.5% difference, that's overall exceptionally good performance from the 5600X in Far Cry New Dawn. Next up we have Rainbow Six Siege and we're finding comparable performance to higher-end Zen 3 parts. More than comparable, it's basically identical. The 5600X was 22% faster than the 3600 and 19% faster than the 3700X, a big generational performance gain. The Ryzen 5 5600X is also able to match the 5800X, 5900X and 5950X in the Watch Dogs: Legion. That makes it 23% faster than the 3600, and 15% faster than the 3700X. It also edged out the 10600K by a 5% margin making it the fastest 6-core processor in this title. Moving on to F1 2020, we're again finding similar performance across the Zen 3 range. There's up to a 3% difference between the 5600X and 5950X when looking at the 1% low results. In other words, virtually identical performance and that means the 5600X is 9% faster than the 10600K, 20% faster than the 3700X and 28% faster than the 3600. For the first time in our gaming tests we're seeing the 5600X slip behind the higher core count parts. It wasn't that much slower in Horizon Zero Dawn, trailing the 5950X by up to 10% for the 1% low result and 4% on average. Performance is comparable to the Core i5-10600K, which is 16% faster than the 3700X and almost 30% faster than the 3600. The gains in Borderlands 3 are fairly small compared to most other titles. We're looking at a 7% performance improvement over equivalent Zen 2 parts. The 5600X is comparable to Intel's 10600K in this game, too. Death Stranding can take advantage of higher core counts on the 5900X and 5950X, though it seems to max out with the 5900X. As a result, the 5600X was 11% slower than than the 5900X and 7% slower than the 5800X, though performance was comparable to the 10900K, or at least the average frame rate performance was. When compared to the 10600K, we're looking at a solid 18% performance improvement and a whopping 23% improvement over the 3700X. So here's an example of a core heavy, CPU utilization heavy game that still sees the 5600X obliterate the 3700X. It's also 33% faster than the Ryzen 5 3600. Another CPU demanding game we like to test with is Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Do note we're not using the built-in benchmark, but an open world section that's much more CPU demanding than most other places in the game. SoTR looks to be maxed out with the 5900X. The 5600X was 7% slower that the 12-core CPU and 4% slower than the 5800X and Core i9-10900K. That said, it was 5% faster than the 10700K, 20% faster than the 10600K, 23% faster than the 3700X, and 31% faster than the 3600. Hitman 2 performance is interesting as this isn't a game that benefited from more cores with Zen 2. Clearly memory and cache latency was the primary bottleneck as we do see positive core scaling with Intel processors and now with Zen 3 chips. The Ryzen 5 5600X was able to match the average frame rate of the 5800X, though it was 7% slower for the 1% low result. It also trailed the 5900X by 8% for the average frame rate and 13% for the 1% low. When compared to the 10600K it was 15% faster and then a massive 26% faster than the 3700X and 32% faster than the 3600. Testing with Star Wars: Squadrons shows a ~23% performance boost over the 6 and 8-core Zen 2 processors and a 16% boost over the 10600K. The 5600X's performance output was comparable to the 10900K here. Serious Sam 4 is an NPC heavy title which does benefit from more cores. In this case, the 5800X looks to be the sweet spot as the 5600X was 16% slower, though game time performance was strong and we didn't see any stuttering issues with the 6-core processor. We're also talking about a 26% boost over the 3700X and 16% greater 1% low performance. Gaming Average Here's an overview of the average CPU gaming performance and overall we see a small performance decline when compared to the Ryzen 7 5800X across the 11 games tested. Of course, the margin is very game dependent. When compared to the 8-core 3700X we're looking at a 19% performance boost on average and 24% over the 3600. In other words, the mainstream Ryzen 5 5600X is a much better gaming CPU. It's worth keeping in mind that all tests were conducted at 1080p using a GeForce RTX 3090. Now obviously we do this as the focus is on CPU and not GPU performance, but be aware this isn't typical gaming performance. Normally you'd be using an RTX 3090 at 1440p or 4K gaming: at 1440p you'll be a lot more GPU limited, while at 4K you'll be entirely GPU limited. So don't think an upgrade from the Ryzen 3 3600 to the 5600X will net you around 20% more performance. In the coming weeks we'll likely investigate CPU scaling with a range of GPUs, but for now we're looking more at CPU limited gaming performance. Getting back to the results, it's really impressive to see AMD now offering 11% more performance than Intel's best 6-core processor, the 10600K and we'll look at cost per frame data in a moment, before that though here are the OC results. Overclocking When it comes to manual overclocking we were able to push the Ryzen 5 5600X to 4.6 GHz on all cores. This boosted Cinebench R20's multi-core performance by just 3%, so a fairly pointless overclock. Although we're getting a 3% boost to all core performance, we're also seeing a 1% decline in single core. Blender confirms the all-core gains of 3% for the overclocked 5600X. Not exactly a worthwhile gain and it doesn't help the 5600X catch up to the 3700X here. For that 3% performance boost we're looking at a 4% increase in total system power usage, so hardly anything to worry about. And here's why we don't recommend gamers bother with overclocking the 5600X: we ended up reducing the frame rate in Rainbow Six Siege by 4%. As we've seen before, it does help to improve performance ever so slightly in Far Cry New Dawn, though certainly not to the degree that anyone is going to notice. Price to Performance Here's a look at the price vs. performance ratio using Cinebench R20's multi-core data. At the new $300 price point, the Ryzen 5 5600X isn't exactly great value in core-heavy workloads. While it does match the Ryzen 7 3700X in value, it's also coming in at a 26% premium over the 3600 and that's not great. In order to match the value of the 3600, the 5600X would need to cost no more than $240, so here's to hoping the $220 vanilla version of the 5600 ends up being a thing. Now, the reason the 5600X costs $300 is because of the Core i5-10600K. Compared to Intel's competing part the 5600X is 12% better value. It's a similar situation when we look at Adobe Premiere data: the 5600X stacks up pretty well overall, but is still much worse value than the 3600, coming in at a massive 37% premium. You're also paying a 14% premium over the 3600 for gaming in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, though that's not terrible given the performance improvement, and it's still better value than Intel's 10600K. If we look at the 11 game sample, we see that in terms of value the 5600X and 10600K are comparable. Overall, the new 6-core Ryzen processor is fetching a 21% price premium when compared to the 3600, so that's not great news. What We Learned On one side, it's impressive just how much better the Ryzen 5 5600X is when compared to the 10600K , often offering more value despite costing a little more. On the other side though, it's far less impressive in terms of value when compared to the $200 Ryzen 5 3600. While we do see a number of substantial performance improvements, a 50% price hike is going to be a tough pill to swallow for most. AMD's really competing with themselves: if you want maximum value, get the R5 3600 , if you want maximum performance, get the 5600X and that leaves no room for Intel's Core i5-10600K. It's worth point out that the Ryzen 5 3600 sold really well relative to the 10600K because it was cheaper. And while it is technically slower in games, when gaming you're going to be GPU bound for the most part, and therefore the reality is that gaming performance is very close between those two. This also means gamers will remain better off buying the much cheaper Ryzen 5 3600, or waiting to see if a $220 non-X 5600 becomes a thing in the not too distant future. Speaking of gaming performance, you're no doubt going to hear nonsense such as ""the Ryzen 5 5600X is a poor choice for gamers as it only has 6 cores,"" and they'll probably try and prove that by pointing to the new consoles which feature eight Zen 2 cores. Some people also like to confuse how games and cores work. Making statements like games will require 8 cores or something to that effect. Games don't require a certain number of cores, they never have and they never will. Games require a certain level of CPU performance, it's really that simple. A recent example of that is the Core i5-7600K , or in other words, quad-core processors. Three years ago the 7600K was the best value gaming CPU on the market and it shredded the Ryzen 5 1600 in every game. However, back then we did say that the 7600K's days were counted as games were becoming more demanding and soon 4-cores/4-thread processors would be inadequate, stick with me here... That wasn't because games would necessarily require more than 4 cores, but because there wasn't a single quad-core processor in existence that would be powerful enough to drive the latest and greatest games without avoiding frame stuttering issues and other performance related problems. For example, if the 7600K was capable of out-scoring the Ryzen 5 1600 in Cinebench R20's multi-core test, it would actually be a better gaming CPU today, regardless of how many cores it featured. However, that's not the case. The R5 1600 scores 53% higher in Cinebench and even when overclocking the 7600K to 5 GHz, the Ryzen part is over 30% faster. So, when fully utilized the Ryzen 5 1600 is a more powerful processor, which is why we knew in the not too distant future it would be a better processor for games and that's long since been proven true. However, the Core i7-7700K hasn't yet suffered quite the same fate despite also being a quad-core processor, as it features SMT support for 8 threads. Although it features half as many cores and threads as the Ryzen 7 1700 , it's able to keep up in the latest and greatest games, though it is starting to show some weakness in most demanding titles. At some point, we do expect the R7 1700 to beat the 7700K in games and again if we look at the Cinebench R20 multi-core performance, we see that when fully utilized the Ryzen processor is almost 40% faster and that's obviously a massive difference. But what about the 6-core, 12-thread Ryzen 5 5600X, how will it age? Our guess is extremely well as the massive IPC increase offered by the new Zen 3 architecture means the 5600X is comparable to previous generation 8-core processors such as the 3700X and 10700K, or the Zen 2 parts used in the next gen consoles, and no one expects those processors to become obsolete any time soon. Looking at Cinebench R20 as a rough guide, we see that the 5600X's multi-core performance is just 9% lower than that of the 3700X and 10% lower than the 10700K, and that's not a big difference. It's also worth noting that you need to be cautious when using Cinebench to measure heavy CPU utilized gaming performance. We use it to observe how CPUs might compare when fully utilized in games, but Cinebench isn't particularly memory sensitive, so a CPU like the 5600X which is much improved compared to the 3700X in terms of cache and memory latency, will perform better in games under heavy load than the Cinebench R20 score would suggest. The memory and cache latency improvements of the Ryzen 5 5600X means that there's a good chance it will never end up being slower than the 3700X in games. Doesn't matter if you're talking average frame rates or frame time performance, it should be better by all metrics. If you have the option of the Ryzen 5 5600X or the 3700X for $300, you should absolutely get the 5600X in our opinion. It's a lot better right now in games and we expect that still be the case in a few years' time. Or save your money and get the R5 3600 as it still gets the most out of high-end GPUs at 1440p, or if you can wait for the Ryzen 5 5600."
